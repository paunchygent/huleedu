## Purpose

This directory contains research materials that inform the design and implementation of HuleEdu's assessment platform, particularly around comparative judgement (CJ) and automated essay assessment.

## Key Research Areas

1. **Comparative Judgement (CJ)**
   - Adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ)
   - Reliability and validity of CJ methods
   - Reference-based adaptive selection algorithms

2. **Assessment Technology**
   - Automated essay scoring
   - Grade prediction and calibration
   - Confidence estimation

3. **Educational Measurement**
   - Validity and reliability in assessment
   - Rater agreement and calibration
   - Assessment efficiency

## Maintenance

- Papers should be kept in original format (PDF/MD)
- Validation reports should include dates and batch IDs
- Update this index when adding new research areas
