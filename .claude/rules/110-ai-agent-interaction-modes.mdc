# 110: AI Agent Interaction Modes

## 1. General Interaction Principles

- **MUST** understand user request, codebase context, and applicable rules before action
- **MUST** adhere to rules and HuleEdu architecture
- **MUST** use provided tools (no simulation)
- **MUST** explain tool actions briefly
- **MUST** structure responses clearly
- **MUST** cite sources with file and line numbers
- **MUST** update documentation as part of task completion

## 2. Operational Modes

- **Planning Mode**: Task analysis and execution planning
- **Coding Mode**: Code generation and modification
- **Testing Mode**: Test creation, execution, and evaluation
- **Debugging Mode**: Issue identification and resolution
- **Refactoring/Linting Mode**: Code improvement and style fixes

## 3. State Management
- **SHOULD** maintain context about current task, relevant files, and architectural constraints
