# Golden Rules

1. **workflow** — Always follow the established workflow to ensure consistency, quality, and proper task execution
2. **No vibe-coding** — Every production change needs a decision, epic, and story/fix
3. **No legacy support** — Pure prototype codebase, avoid deprecation paths
4. **SOLID/YAGNI/DDD** — Leave code cleaner than you found it
5. **Use the rules** — Reference `.agent/rules/` and `docs/` for detailed guidance
