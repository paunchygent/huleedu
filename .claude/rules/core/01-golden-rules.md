# Golden Rules

1. **No vibe-coding** — Every production change needs a decision, epic, and story/fix
2. **No legacy support** — Pure prototype codebase, avoid deprecation paths
3. **SOLID/YAGNI/DDD** — Leave code cleaner than you found it
4. **Use the rules** — Reference `.agent/rules/` and `docs/` for detailed guidance
