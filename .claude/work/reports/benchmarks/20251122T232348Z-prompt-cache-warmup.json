Comprehension checks jumped, but more importantly, students began creating their own analogies. The shift reminded me that modeling cognitive moves is a prerequisite for expecting them.\n\n**Essay B (ID: essay-3):**\nDuring a group history project, I monopolized research because I feared missing the deadline. The final presentation felt one-dimensional. Next time I will set explicit checkpoints and rotate ownership so we capture multiple perspectives and avoid last minute scrambling.\n\nUsing the Student Assignment, Assessment Criteria, and Judge Instructions above, determine which essay better fulfills the requirements.
