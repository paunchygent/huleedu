A role model is someone you look up to, maybe someone you want to be. To have a role model in your life can affect you both in an positive or negative way, I would deffinetaly say that it depends on who the person in question is.\u00a0\nWhen we were in first grade, all my friends wanted to be like all the tiktok famous girls who danced, got free products and looked amazing. Their lifestyle seemed to be spotless and\n even tho we were so little and still had our entire childhood left, we wanted to be exactly like them. Now I look back and find it kinda sad that seven year olds wanted to have the same look and life as twentyfive year old grown women who probably edited their pictures and videos. But at that time, they seemed so perfect and it made you question yourself in an unhealthy way. I think that was the first time I started to doubt myself and my own looks, the pressure to be skinny and perfect got put in our head\ns as seven years old girls.\nA role model can also be great for you, it could be someone who really inspires you and your goals. It could be a person who works with your dreamjob, for an example a rockstar or a writer. If your idol has something you really want and helps you to reach that goal in a healthy way, I think it\u00b4s a great way to grow as human. The role model could also be our parents,\u00a0I can only speak for myself but I think that most of the people recognize themself when I say that our parents we\nre the first persons we looked up to. They seemed to always be right and I just assumed that everything they said was correct, that they always wanted my best and that they would always be on my side as a safe place to go. This was in some ways right, I know that my parents will always be there for me but I can\u00b4t assume that they magically will fix my life everything something gets hard. That\u00b4s not how life works, we have to be our own person at some point and I\u00b4ve realized that my parents aren\u00b4t perfect.\u00a0\nMy role model isn\u00b4t a famous person, an influencer or even my parents. It\u00b4s the same person who was with me in first grade when we first started to doubt ourselfs, when life suddenly felt hard and everything got real, my best friend. She has been with me since three years old and we got thru everything together. We\u00b4ve shared our life with eachother to the point where it feels like her life is mine and my life is hers. When something great happens to her, Im just as happy as her and when something bad happ\nens, I\u00b4m right by her side to give her comfort. My best friend knows me better than anyone and she\u00b4s always there for me no matter what. I think that it\u00b4s really important to look around and see everything you have and all the persons who cares about instead of always reaching for the \n\"perfect\" life and the unhealty ideal. Everything and everyone we need is most often around us and your true role model can be closer than you think.\u00a0",

When something great happens to her, Im just as happy as her and when something bad happ\nens, I\u00b4m right by her side to give her comfort. My best friend knows me better than anyone and she\u00b4s always there for me no matter what. I think that it\u00b4s really important to look around and see everything you have and all the persons who cares about instead of always reaching for the \n\"perfect\" life and the unhealty ideal. Everything and everyone we need is most often around us and your true role model can be closer than you think.\u00a0",

A role model can for example be a family member or a famous person. I think everyone has an important role, everyone should always act like a good role model. Do you look up to someone? Who? Why do you look up to that person?\nI think the role models people have nowadays is the persons that shows respect to others, someone who has the abillity to influence people and change their opinions to the better. But a lot of people has \u00a0someone who stands them close as a role model, like their mother, father, grandparents, or siblings. I would say it's because you've grown up with them, they've shown you how to do things, teached you things that was important then but also is important now, and they've always been your biggest supporters even tho it may not always seem like it.\u00a0\nRole models influences people in different ways, but if you look up to someone, that person often has a hold on you and is able to affect such things as opinions, attitude and life style, basically how you are as a person and what you do. If your role model dresses in a special way, you may start dressing like that to.\nMy role model is my grandmother, that's because she's the sweetest, strongest, most caring person i know. She always shows respect to others, and she always puts everyones needs before hers. Everytime you need help or maybe just company, she's there and supports you no matter what. When my grandfather was in the hospital, she would be there for her family, even tho she was the one who needed the support from us. Ever since I was little, she's been by my side, and she's always been, and will always be my best friend.\nI hope this text tells you what a role model is, how they matter for people, and how they affect young and older people.\u00a0\n\nUsing the Student Assignment, Assessment Criteria, and Judge Instructions above, determine which essay better fulfills the requirements.

I think these diffrent kinds are the most popular because of the hope they can give. these people are those who say to never give up on your dreams and always fight, especially parents. Sadly there are a lot of parents who don't push there children to get better and reach for there goals, there are even parents who can't do that. That's why I think the famous people who has a lot of admierers have to really have to keep telling people to reach for their goals and fight for what they want because I think If you really want something bad, you are going to get that.\nRole models can change someone very much I would say. They often say things such as \"Never give up\" or \"Always work towards your dreams\" which gives you motivation and sometimes dicipline. These things form you as a person, I personally think that If your role model Is a humble and good person you can and will also be that. Role models form our society because every single one that reads this text looks up to someone whether they want to or not. Do you think you look up to a good role model that will change you In a posetive way?\nI think most role models have more responsebility than they think and don't always think before acting and I don't think It Is easy knowing you are a role model especially for famous people. But I think that It should be more talked about from the people who know they have a lot of people that admire them. \u00a0\nMy greatest role model is my uncle, I do have a lot of role models and I think that most of you readers also do but my uncle Kalle is the one person I really look up to.

He Is also my role model because he fails over and over again till he wins. He never quit and that is why I look up to him.\u00a0\nI think It Is very important to have a \"Kalle\" in your life because you never know what life throws at you and It Is important to always have someone who pushes you and brings you motivation. Do you feel like you have a a person like this or maybe you even feel like you are this person.\nI think that role models change the world both posetively and negatively. There are people who look up to terorist and there are people who look up to god, very diffrent right? Do you think that you look up to someone that makes you better, smarter or stronger.\u00a0\nNow that I have said what I think, I want you to think about what makes your role model good or bad and how they have changed you.",

Do you think you look up to a good role model that will change you In a posetive way?\nI think most role models have more responsebility than they think and don't always think before acting and I don't think It Is easy knowing you are a role model especially for famous people. But I think that It should be more talked about from the people who know they have a lot of people that admire them. \u00a0\nMy greatest role model is my uncle, I do have a lot of role models and I think that most of you readers also do but my uncle Kalle is the one person I really look up to.

He Is also my role model because he fails over and over again till he wins. He never quit and that is why I look up to him.\u00a0\nI think It Is very important to have a \"Kalle\" in your life because you never know what life throws at you and It Is important to always have someone who pushes you and brings you motivation. Do you feel like you have a a person like this or maybe you even feel like you are this person.\nI think that role models change the world both posetively and negatively. There are people who look up to terorist and there are people who look up to god, very diffrent right?

The ones I've heard of the most are athletes, celebrities and parents, Is your role model one of these? If it they're not what category do they fit in? I think these diffrent kinds are the most popular because of the hope they can give. these people are those who say to never give up on your dreams and always fight, especially parents. Sadly there are a lot of parents who don't push there children to get better and reach for there goals, there are even parents who can't do that. That's why I think the famous people who has a lot of admierers have to really have to keep telling people to reach for their goals and fight for what they want because I think If you really want something bad, you are going to get that.\nRole models can change someone very much I would say. They often say things such as \"Never give up\" or \"Always work towards your dreams\" which gives you motivation and sometimes dicipline.

A role model is someone you look up to, maybe someone you want to be. To have a role model in your life can affect you both in an positive or negative way, I would deffinetaly say that it depends on who the person in question is.\u00a0\nWhen we were in first grade, all my friends wanted to be like all the tiktok famous girls who danced, got free products and looked amazing. Their lifestyle seemed to be spotless and\n even tho we were so little and still had our entire childhood left, we wanted to be exactly like them. Now I look back and find it kinda sad that seven year olds wanted to have the same look and life as twentyfive year old grown women who probably edited their pictures and videos. But at that time, they seemed so perfect and it made you question yourself in an unhealthy way. I think that was the first time I started to doubt myself and my own looks, the pressure to be skinny and perfect got put in our head\ns as seven years old girls.\nA role model can also be great for you, it could be someone who really inspires you and your goals. It could be a person who works with your dreamjob, for an example a rockstar or a writer. If your idol has something you really want and helps you to reach that goal in a healthy way, I think it\u00b4s a great way to grow as human. The role model could also be our parents,\u00a0I can only speak for myself but I think that most of the people recognize themself when I say that our parents we\nre the first persons we looked up to. They seemed to always be right and I just assumed that everything they said was correct, that they always wanted my best and that they would always be on my side as a safe place to go. This was in some ways right, I know that my parents will always be there for me but I can\u00b4t assume that they magically will fix my life everything something gets hard. That\u00b4s not how life works, we have to be our own person at some point and I\u00b4ve realized that my parents aren\u00b4t perfect.\u00a0\nMy role model isn\u00b4t a famous person, an influencer or even my parents. It\u00b4s the same person who was with me in first grade when we first started to doubt ourselfs, when life suddenly felt hard and everything got real, my best friend. She has been with me since three years old and we got thru everything together. We\u00b4ve shared our life with eachother to the point where it feels like her life is mine and my life is hers. When something great happens to her, Im just as happy as her and when something bad happ\nens, I\u00b4m right by her side to give her comfort. My best friend knows me better than anyone and she\u00b4s always there for me no matter what. I think that it\u00b4s really important to look around and see everything you have and all the persons who cares about instead of always reaching for the \n\"perfect\" life and the unhealty ideal. Everything and everyone we need is most often around us and your true role model can be closer than you think.\u00a0",

In this text I am going to talk about what a role model \nis, \u00a0what\n a role model is for me and talk about who inspires me the most.\nSo, what is a role model? A role model is someone that inspires you and someone people can look up to. They influence people in general. They can have a lot of money, they can have done something good for the people, they can have \na\n influencing life story. People can be role models in a lot of \ndifferents\n ways.\u00a0\nFor me a role model is someone that has \nearnd\n a lot of money in a good way or someone with an \ninspiering\n life story, people with either one of those are people that \ni\n can look up to and take tips from. For me the role models have the responsibilities to be good to other people and \ndont\n do any bad stuff so people \ndont\n take influence of that.\u00a0\nToday people have a lot of different kinds of role models. Some people look up to peoples that are good at \nthere\n sport so that they can be as good as them, other \npoeples\n look up to someone that has \nearnd\n a ton of money \nbecuase\n they also want to earn a lot of money and be \nritch\n like there role model and \nsom\n people look up to criminals in there \ncomunity\n \nbecuase\n they think that that is the only way to go.\nThe person that influence me the most is a \nfotball\n player named Cristiano Ronaldo and I look up to him \nbecuase\n he is the best \nfotball\n player that has ever lived and \nbecuase\n he has a very special life story. He has played in \nall of\n the top \nleauges\n in the top teams and has made a lot of goals. He holds a ton of records and has won ballon \ndor\n (price for the best player in the world) a lot of times. He grew up very poor and a lot of family problems and had people who didn\u00b4t \nbelived\n in him but he proved them all wrong and became the best player ever and \nearnd\n a lot of money. He has always stayed \nfit\n and he still is now at the end of his career.

          "content": "**Essay B (ID: Elias Kuhlin (BF24 Eng5 NP Writing Role Models)):**\nEng5 NP Writing: Role Models\nEK24001@harryda.se\nAntal ord: 544\nThere Is a lot of different kinds of role models nowadays . The ones I've heard of the most are athletes, celebrities and parents, Is your role model one of these? If it they're not what category do they fit in? I think these diffrent kinds are the most popular because of the hope they can give. these people are those who say to never give up on your dreams and always fight, especially parents. Sadly there are a lot of parents who don't push there children to get better and reach for there goals, there are even parents who can't do that. That's why I think the famous people who has a lot of admierers have to really have to keep telling people to reach for their goals and fight for what they want because I think If you really want something bad, you are going to get that.\nRole models can change someone very much I would say. They often say things such as \"Never give up\" or \"Always work towards your dreams\" which gives you motivation and sometimes dicipline. These things form you as a person, I personally think that If your role model Is a humble and good person you can and will also be that. Role models form our society because every single one that reads this text looks up to someone whether they want to or not. Do you think you look up to a good role model that will change you In a posetive way?\nI think most role models have more responsebility than they think and don't always think before acting and I don't think It Is easy knowing you are a role model especially for famous people. But I think that It should be more talked about from the people who know they have a lot of people that admire them. \u00a0\nMy greatest role model is my uncle, I do have a lot of role models and I think that most of you readers also do but my uncle Kalle is the one person I really look up to. Karl August Opp\u00e4ng called \"Kalle\" is 23 years old and he lives In sweden gothenburg. Kalle Is one of the few people In my life that always belived In me whatever I wanted to do. He Is also my role model because he fails over and over again till he wins. He never quit and that is why I look up to him.\u00a0\nI think It Is very important to have a \"Kalle\" in your life because you never know what life throws at you and It Is important to always have someone who pushes you and brings you motivation. Do you feel like you have a a person like this or maybe you even feel like you are this person.\nI think that role models change the world both posetively and negatively. There are people who look up to terorist and there are people who look up to god, very diffrent right? Do you think that you look up to someone that makes you better, smarter or stronger.\u00a0\nNow that I have said what I think, I want you to think about what makes your role model good or bad and how they have changed you.",

A role model is someone you look up to, maybe someone you want to be. To have a role model in your life can affect you both in an positive or negative way, I would deffinetaly say that it depends on who the person in question is.\u00a0\nWhen we were in first grade, all my friends wanted to be like all the tiktok famous girls who danced, got free products and looked amazing. Their lifestyle seemed to be spotless and\n even tho we were so little and still had our entire childhood left, we wanted to be exactly like them. Now I look back and find it kinda sad that seven year olds wanted to have the same look and life as twentyfive year old grown women who probably edited their pictures and videos. But at that time, they seemed so perfect and it made you question yourself in an unhealthy way. I think that was the first time I started to doubt myself and my own looks, the pressure to be skinny and perfect got put in our head\ns as seven years old girls.\nA role model can also be great for you, it could be someone who really inspires you and your goals. It could be a person who works with your dreamjob, for an example a rockstar or a writer. If your idol has something you really want and helps you to reach that goal in a healthy way, I think it\u00b4s a great way to grow as human. The role model could also be our parents,\u00a0I can only speak for myself but I think that most of the people recognize themself when I say that our parents we\nre the first persons we looked up to. They seemed to always be right and I just assumed that everything they said was correct, that they always wanted my best and that they would always be on my side as a safe place to go. This was in some ways right, I know that my parents will always be there for me but I can\u00b4t assume that they magically will fix my life everything something gets hard. That\u00b4s not how life works, we have to be our own person at some point and I\u00b4ve realized that my parents aren\u00b4t perfect.\u00a0\nMy role model isn\u00b4t a famous person, an influencer or even my parents. It\u00b4s the same person who was with me in first grade when we first started to doubt ourselfs, when life suddenly felt hard and everything got real, my best friend. She has been with me since three years old and we got thru everything together. We\u00b4ve shared our life with eachother to the point where it feels like her life is mine and my life is hers. When something great happens to her, Im just as happy as her and when something bad happ\nens, I\u00b4m right by her side to give her comfort. My best friend knows me better than anyone and she\u00b4s always there for me no matter what. I think that it\u00b4s really important to look around and see everything you have and all the persons who cares about instead of always reaching for the \n\"perfect\" life and the unhealty ideal.

A role model is someone you look up to, maybe someone you want to be. To have a role model in your life can affect you both in an positive or negative way, I would deffinetaly say that it depends on who the person in question is.\u00a0\nWhen we were in first grade, all my friends wanted to be like all the tiktok famous girls who danced, got free products and looked amazing. Their lifestyle seemed to be spotless and\n even tho we were so little and still had our entire childhood left, we wanted to be exactly like them. Now I look back and find it kinda sad that seven year olds wanted to have the same look and life as twentyfive year old grown women who probably edited their pictures and videos. But at that time, they seemed so perfect and it made you question yourself in an unhealthy way. I think that was the first time I started to doubt myself and my own looks, the pressure to be skinny and perfect got put in our head\ns as seven years old girls.\nA role model can also be great for you, it could be someone who really inspires you and your goals. It could be a person who works with your dreamjob, for an example a rockstar or a writer. If your idol has something you really want and helps you to reach that goal in a healthy way, I think it\u00b4s a great way to grow as human. The role model could also be our parents,\u00a0I can only speak for myself but I think that most of the people recognize themself when I say that our parents we\nre the first persons we looked up to. They seemed to always be right and I just assumed that everything they said was correct, that they always wanted my best and that they would always be on my side as a safe place to go. This was in some ways right, I know that my parents will always be there for me but I can\u00b4t assume that they magically will fix my life everything something gets hard. That\u00b4s not how life works, we have to be our own person at some point and I\u00b4ve realized that my parents aren\u00b4t perfect.\u00a0\nMy role model isn\u00b4t a famous person, an influencer or even my parents. It\u00b4s the same person who was with me in first grade when we first started to doubt ourselfs, when life suddenly felt hard and everything got real, my best friend. She has been with me since three years old and we got thru everything together. We\u00b4ve shared our life with eachother to the point where it feels like her life is mine and my life is hers. When something great happens to her, Im just as happy as her and when something bad happ\nens, I\u00b4m right by her side to give her comfort. My best friend knows me better than anyone and she\u00b4s always there for me no matter what. I think that it\u00b4s really important to look around and see everything you have and all the persons who cares about instead of always reaching for the \n\"perfect\" life and the unhealty ideal. Everything and everyone we need is most often around us and your true role model can be closer than you think.\u00a0",

Some people look up to peoples that are good at \nthere\n sport so that they can be as good as them, other \npoeples\n look up to someone that has \nearnd\n a ton of money \nbecuase\n they also want to earn a lot of money and be \nritch\n like there role model and \nsom\n people look up to criminals in there \ncomunity\n \nbecuase\n they think that that is the only way to go.\nThe person that influence me the most is a \nfotball\n player named Cristiano Ronaldo and I look up to him \nbecuase\n he is the best \nfotball\n player that has ever lived and \nbecuase\n he has a very special life story. He has played in \nall of\n the top \nleauges\n in the top teams and has made a lot of goals. He holds a ton of records and has won ballon \ndor\n (price for the best player in the world) a lot of times. He grew up very poor and a lot of family problems and had people who didn\u00b4t \nbelived\n in him but he proved them all wrong and became the best player ever and \nearnd\n a lot of money. He has always stayed \nfit\n and he still is now at the end of his career. And I think that he can influence a lot of people even people who isn\u00b4t \nin to\n \nfotball\n.\nI think that every person \nneed\n someone that they can look up to and that they can take influence from. So that they have someone that they wants to be like and take tips from to make them a better and funnier life\n.",

My role model is a rapper named Eminem and not because he's a cool badass guy just because he had so much problems growing up. A drug user as mum and a dad that was gone. He didn't have it easy in school either and not that much friends. He went on some battels when he was a teen but failed over again. Even thought he had so many down paths he manage to become Successful. And now hes the world's famous rapper. Eminem influence me with his thinking of never give up and be who you are. With that two things i think you could go really far, at least it had helped me along the way.\n \nThe sad thing with successful and famous persons these days is because they are stucked with the money and in the fame so they don't think and see anything els around it.

Their lifestyle seemed to be spotless and\n even tho we were so little and still had our entire childhood left, we wanted to be exactly like them. Now I look back and find it kinda sad that seven year olds wanted to have the same look and life as twentyfive year old grown women who probably edited their pictures and videos. But at that time, they seemed so perfect and it made you question yourself in an unhealthy way. I think that was the first time I started to doubt myself and my own looks, the pressure to be skinny and perfect got put in our head\ns as seven years old girls.\nA role model can also be great for you, it could be someone who really inspires you and your goals. It could be a person who works with your dreamjob, for an example a rockstar or a writer. If your idol has something you really want and helps you to reach that goal in a healthy way, I think it\u00b4s a great way to grow as human. The role model could also be our parents,\u00a0I can only speak for myself but I think that most of the people recognize themself when I say that our parents we\nre the first persons we looked up to. They seemed to always be right and I just assumed that everything they said was correct, that they always wanted my best and that they would always be on my side as a safe place to go.

A role model can for example be a family member or a famous person. I think everyone has an important role, everyone should always act like a good role model. Do you look up to someone? Who? Why do you look up to that person?\nI think the role models people have nowadays is the persons that shows respect to others, someone who has the abillity to influence people and change their opinions to the better. But a lot of people has \u00a0someone who stands them close as a role model, like their mother, father, grandparents, or siblings. I would say it's because you've grown up with them, they've shown you how to do things, teached you things that was important then but also is important now, and they've always been your biggest supporters even tho it may not always seem like it.\u00a0\nRole models influences people in different ways, but if you look up to someone, that person often has a hold on you and is able to affect such things as opinions, attitude and life style, basically how you are as a person and what you do. If your role model dresses in a special way, you may start dressing like that to.\nMy role model is my grandmother, that's because she's the sweetest, strongest, most caring person i know. She always shows respect to others, and she always puts everyones needs before hers. Everytime you need help or maybe just company, she's there and supports you no matter what. When my grandfather was in the hospital, she would be there for her family, even tho she was the one who needed the support from us. Ever since I was little, she's been by my side, and she's always been, and will always be my best friend.\nI hope this text tells you what a role model is, how they matter for people, and how they affect young and older people.\u00a0",

A role model can for example be a family member or a famous person. I think everyone has an important role, everyone should always act like a good role model. Do you look up to someone? Who? Why do you look up to that person?\nI think the role models people have nowadays is the persons that shows respect to others, someone who has the abillity to influence people and change their opinions to the better. But a lot of people has \u00a0someone who stands them close as a role model, like their mother, father, grandparents, or siblings. I would say it's because you've grown up with them, they've shown you how to do things, teached you things that was important then but also is important now, and they've always been your biggest supporters even tho it may not always seem like it.\u00a0\nRole models influences people in different ways, but if you look up to someone, that person often has a hold on you and is able to affect such things as opinions, attitude and life style, basically how you are as a person and what you do. If your role model dresses in a special way, you may start dressing like that to.\nMy role model is my grandmother, that's because she's the sweetest, strongest, most caring person i know. She always shows respect to others, and she always puts everyones needs before hers. Everytime you need help or maybe just company, she's there and supports you no matter what. When my grandfather was in the hospital, she would be there for her family, even tho she was the one who needed the support from us. Ever since I was little, she's been by my side, and she's always been, and will always be my best friend.\nI hope this text tells you what a role model is, how they matter for people, and how they affect young and older people.\u00a0\n\nUsing the Student Assignment, Assessment Criteria, and Judge Instructions above, determine which essay better fulfills the requirements.

For example we got actors, singers, artists and a lot more. \"normal people\" get very influenced by these peoples because they are famous and very successful. So they have a big affect on us and make us think what they do is always right. I think this famous persons should lead by example and behaive good in public. My role model is a rapper named Eminem and not because he's a cool badass guy just because he had so much problems growing up. A drug user as mum and a dad that was gone. He didn't have it easy in school either and not that much friends. He went on some battels when he was a teen but failed over again. Even thought he had so many down paths he manage to become Successful. And now hes the world's famous rapper. Eminem influence me with his thinking of never give up and be who you are. With that two things i think you could go really far, at least it had helped me along the way.\n \nThe sad thing with successful and famous persons these days is because they are stucked with the money and in the fame so they don't think and see anything els around it. Ofcourse we can't draw all over the same brush but the majerity is. To get a better society the movie preducers could make films about peace and love instead of war and crime. Singers stop to sing abot drugs, sex and voilence for example.",
