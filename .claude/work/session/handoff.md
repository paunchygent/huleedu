- **Service READMEs** – Service-specific patterns, error handling, testing
- **.claude/rules/** – Implementation standards and requirements
- **docs/operations/** – Operational runbooks
- **TASKS/** – Detailed task documentation

Use this file to coordinate what the very next agent should focus on.
