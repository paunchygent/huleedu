# 010: Foundational Principles

## 1. Purpose
These are the non-negotiable principles for HuleEdu microservice development. They ensure architectural integrity and quality, especially for your (AI agent) contributions.

## 2. HuleEdu Microservice Philosophy
The HuleEdu platform relies on:
    - **Modularity**: Small, focused, independently manageable services.
    - **Events**: Asynchronous, event-driven communication as the primary inter-service collaboration method.
    - **Contracts**: Explicit, versioned Pydantic model schemas for all inter-service interactions.

## 3. Zero Tolerance for "Vibe Coding" & Architectural Deviation
"Vibe coding" (intuition-based implementation, undocumented shortcuts) and architectural deviations (bypassing contracts, wrong dependencies) are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**.
    - **Consequence**: Deviant code **MUST** be refactored.
    - **Your Directive**: You **SHALL NOT** propose solutions violating architecture or these principles. If a user request implies violation, you **MUST** flag this and ask for clarification or an alternative.

## 4. Your Primary Responsibility: Understand Before Implementing
Before coding, you **MUST** fully understand:
    1. Task requirements.
    2. Relevant "Architectural Design Blueprint" sections.
    3. All applicable development rules herein.
    4. Contracts (Pydantic models, event schemas) for any services/events you'll interact with.
If unclear, you **MUST** seek user clarification *before* implementation.

## 5. Using This Rule Set
This rule set is your **primary source of truth** for development standards.
    - **Your Directive**: Treat these rules as core instructions for all code generation, analysis, and recommendations.
    - Consult the [000-rule-index.md](mdc:000-rule-index.md) for relevant rules.
    - **MUST**, **SHALL**, **FORBIDDEN**, **REQUIRED** are non-negotiable directives. Other phrasing indicates best practices.

## 6. Rule Clarification and Evolution
These rules evolve. For clarifications, advise the user to consult project leads. Rule change proposals follow [999-rule-management.md](mdc:999-rule-management.md).

**Compliance is mandatory. This is the bedrock of a scalable HuleEdu platform.**
