# 090: Documentation Standards

## 1. Purpose
These standards define the requirements for documentation within the HuleEdu project. You (AI agent) **MUST** generate and maintain documentation according to these rules.

## 2. Types of Documentation
    - **Architectural Documentation**: High-level overviews, service boundaries, data flow diagrams (managed separately, not generated by you).
    - **Service Documentation**: READMEs for each service.
    - **Contract Documentation**: Documentation derived from Pydantic models.
    - **Code-Level Documentation**: Docstrings and comments (see [050-python-coding-standards.md](mdc:050-python-coding-standards.md)).
    - **Development Rules**: This set of rules (managed via `.cursor/rules/`).

## 3. Service READMEs

### 3.1. Rule: Mandatory Service READMEs
    - Every microservice directory under `services/` **MUST** have a `README.md` file.

### 3.2. Content Requirements
    - Service READMEs **MUST** include:
        - Concise service purpose and responsibility within its bounded context.
        - Overview of key domain entities it manages.
        - List of events it produces and consumes (with references to `common/events/data_models.py`).
        - Overview of any APIs it exposes (with references to `common/models/api_schemas.py` or service-specific schema files).
        - How to set up and run the service locally (including environment variables).
        - How to run its tests.

### 3.3. Rule: Keep READMEs Current
    - Service READMEs **MUST** be updated whenever the service's functionality, events, or APIs change.
    - **Your Directive**: When you modify a service, you **MUST** propose updates to its `README.md`.

## 4. Contract Documentation (Pydantic Models)

### 4.1. Rule: Pydantic Models as Source of Truth
    - The Pydantic model definitions in `common/models/` **ARE** the primary source of truth for contract documentation.
    - **Your Directive**: You **MUST** reference these models when explaining data structures for events or APIs.

### 4.2. Guideline: Auto-Generation
    - Explore tools to automatically generate documentation (e.g., OpenAPI spec from Quart endpoints, documentation from Pydantic models) from the code.

## 5. Development Rules Documentation

### 5.1. Rule: Rules in `.cursor/rules/`
    - These development rules **SHALL** reside exclusively in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

### 5.2. Rule: MDC Format
    - Rule files **MUST** use the `.mdc` file extension.

### 5.3. Rule: Rule Index
    - The [000-rule-index.mdc](mdc:000-rule-index.mdc) file **MUST** be maintained as an up-to-date index of all rule files.
    - **Your Directive**: When new rule files are added or existing ones renamed, you **MUST** propose an update to the index.

## 6. Updating Documentation

### 6.1. Rule: Documentation as Part of the Task
    - Updating relevant documentation (READMEs, rules index) **MUST** be considered an integral part of any task that changes code or architecture.
    - **Your Directive**: You **MUST** include documentation updates in your task completion steps.

**Clear and current documentation is vital for understanding, using, and maintaining HuleEdu services.**
