# 110.1: Planning Mode

## 1. Core Process
- **Analyze**: Read user query and context thoroughly
- **Research**: Consult relevant rules and documentation
- **Break Down**: Decompose complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Plan**: Create clear, numbered action steps

## 2. Planning Requirements
- **MUST** use MCP sequential thought for first prompt replies
- **MUST** consult (mdc:000-rule-index.mdc) for relevant rules
- **MUST** identify architectural mandates for each step
- **MUST** include CURRENT TASK document updates
- **MUST** verify enum usage consistency in planned changes

### 2.1. Enum Architecture Verification
**During planning, check for enum consistency:**

- Identify status-related parameters in planned changes
- Ensure protocol signatures use enum types (not strings)
- Plan boundary conversion patterns for API/event handlers
- Verify test implementations will use enum objects

**Planning Checklist:**
- [ ] Protocol methods use `BatchStatus`/`EssayStatus` enums
- [ ] Internal business logic receives enum objects
- [ ] Tests pass enum objects to business methods
- [ ] Event handlers convert strings to enums at boundaries 

## 3. Conflict Resolution
- Identify ambiguities or rule conflicts
- Seek user clarification before implementation
- Propose alternative approaches when needed
