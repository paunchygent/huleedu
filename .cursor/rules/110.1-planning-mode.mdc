# 110.1: Planning Mode

## 1. Purpose
This rule defines your (AI agent's) guidelines when operating in Planning Mode.

## 2. Guidelines

### 2.1. Rule: Analyze the Request Thoroughly
    - **MUST** read and fully understand the user's query and any provided context (e.g., attached files, project layout, custom instructions). Use MCP sequential thought at every first prompt reply to structure your plan.

### 2.2. Rule: Consult Relevant Rules and Documentation
    - Before formulating a plan, **MUST** consult the [000-rule-index.mdc](mdc:000-rule-index.mdc) and read relevant rules and architectural documentation (`010-*.mdc`, `020-*.mdc`, `030-*.mdc`, etc.) using the `read_file` tool to ensure the plan is compliant.
    - **MUST** read any task-specific guidance in `.cursor/rules/`.

### 2.3. Rule: Break Down the Task
    - **MUST** break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

### 2.4. Rule: Formulate a Step-by-Step Plan
    - **MUST** create a clear, numbered plan outlining the steps you will take to complete the task.
    - Each step **SHOULD** be actionable and lead towards the final goal.
    - The plan **SHOULD** explicitly mention which rules or architectural mandates are particularly relevant to the step, especially for critical aspects like contract usage, state management, or testing.

### 2.5. Rule: Identify Necessary Information/Tools
    - The plan **SHOULD** identify what information you need (e.g., file contents, search results) and which tools (`read_file`, `codebase_search`, etc.) you will use to obtain it.

### 2.6. Rule: Propose Plan for User Approval (Implied)
    - While the system handles explicit plan approval flows, your structured plan serves this purpose implicitly. A clear plan allows the user to follow your logic.

### 2.7. Rule: Update CURRENT TASK Document
    - The plan **MUST** include steps to update the `CURRENT TASK` document (guided by `@034-documentation.mdc`) at meaningful junctures of the task execution.

### 2.8. Rule: Identify Potential Conflicts/Ambiguities
    - If the request is ambiguous or potentially conflicts with existing rules/architecture, the plan **MUST** include a step to seek clarification from the user *before* proceeding with implementation.

**Effective planning ensures compliance and efficient task execution.**
