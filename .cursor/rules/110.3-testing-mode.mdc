# 110.3: Testing Mode

## 1. Core Principles
- **MUST** follow [070-testing-and-quality-assurance.mdc](mdc:070-testing-and-quality-assurance.mdc)
- **MUST** use `pdm run pytest` for all test execution
- **FORBIDDEN**: Fixing tests to make them pass - fix underlying code issues

## 2. Test Priorities
- Prioritize unit and contract tests
- Update contract tests when Pydantic models change
- Write meaningful tests based on requirements, not coverage

## 3. Debugging
- Use `pdm run pytest -s` for debug output
- Analyze test failures and correlate with code changes
- Fix application code, not tests

## 4. Patterns
- Follow [070-testing-and-quality-assurance.mdc](mdc:070-testing-and-quality-assurance.mdc) Sections 3.9-3.11
- Follow [051-pydantic-v2-standards.mdc](mdc:051-pydantic-v2-standards.mdc) Section 8.2
