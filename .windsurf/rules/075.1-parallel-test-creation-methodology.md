# 075.1: Parallel Test Creation Methodology

## Batch Execution Pattern
- **Batch Size**: 3 test files per execution cycle
- **Agent Launch**: Single tool call with 3 parallel test-engineer agents
- **Target Scope**: Related components (handlers, repositories, schemas)
- **File Limits**: 500 LoC maximum per Rule 075

## Mandatory Validation Gates

### Post-Batch Architect Review (Required)
```bash
# After each batch completion, launch lead-dev-code-reviewer regardless of pass/fail status
Task(subagent_type="lead-dev-code-reviewer", ...)
```
**Purpose**: Validate test quality, identify implementation bugs, fix all issues as part of its task,
on its own or by delegating to lead-dev-code-reviewer's own subagents to ensure Rule 075 compliance

**MANDATORY**: Explicitly request "analysis report" and "QC validation" when launching lead-dev-code-reviewer agent
i.e., FORCE the lead-dev-code-reviewer to return a report with a clear analysis of the tests and a clear validation of the tests.

### Quality Gate Sequence
1. **lead-dev-code-reviewer**: Test quality, root cause identification, implementation validation
2. **DI Compliance**: `grep -r "@patch|mock\.patch"` → zero results required  
3. **Test Execution**: `pdm run pytest-root batch_files -v` → 100% pass rate required
4. **Type Safety**: `pdm run typecheck-all` → zero errors required

## Implementation Bug Protocol
- **Detection**: Tests may reveal implementation bugs vs test issues
- **Priority**: Fix implementation first, validate tests second  
- **Validation**: Re-run tests after implementation fixes

## Agent Coordination
- **Test Prompts**: Include Rule 075 requirements, DI patterns, Swedish character support
- **Error Handling**: Use lead-dev-code-reviewer for root cause analysis before fixes
- **Progress Tracking**: TodoWrite tool for batch status and validation checkpoints

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass (100% rate)
- Zero DI violations (@patch usage)
- Rule 075 behavioral testing compliance
- Implementation bugs identified and resolved
