# EPIC: CLIENT_INTERFACE_AND_DYNAMIC_PIPELINE_V1

TASK TICKET: Implement API Gateway and Batch Conductor Service
Status: Ready for Development - Comprehensive Plan Approved

Owner: @LeadDeveloper

Labels: architecture, feature, api-gateway, bcs, fastapi, quart, react-frontend

Depends On: PIPELINE_HARDENING_V1.1 (Event Idempotency)

## 1. Objective

To enable client-facing interactions and dynamic, state-aware pipeline generation by implementing two new core services: the **API Gateway Service** (FastAPI-based for React frontend) and the **Batch Conductor Service** (Quart-based for internal orchestration). This introduces intelligent, dependency-aware pipeline construction while establishing a robust client-facing API architecture.

## 2. Architectural Decisions

### 2.1. Mixed Framework Approach - APPROVED

**API Gateway Service**: FastAPI

- **Justification**: Superior React frontend integration capabilities
- **Benefits**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger docs, enhanced CORS handling, better request/response validation, performance optimization for client-facing APIs
- **Integration**: Must maintain service library compliance (Kafka, logging, metrics)

**Batch Conductor Service**: Quart

- **Justification**: Maintains consistency with internal service architecture
- **Benefits**: Consistent with existing internal service patterns, proven DI integration

### 2.2. Service Responsibilities

**API Gateway Service** (Client-Facing):

- React frontend API endpoints
- Client request validation and rate limiting
- Authentication/authorization (future-ready)
- Kafka command publishing
- Comprehensive API documentation

**Batch Conductor Service** (Internal):

- Pipeline dependency resolution
- Batch state analysis via ELS integration
- Internal HTTP API for BOS

## 3. Key Deliverables

### 3.1. API Gateway Service (FastAPI-based)

**Core Features**:

- [ ] FastAPI-based microservice (api_gateway_service) with uvicorn
- [ ] Client-facing HTTP endpoint: `POST /v1/batches/{batch_id}/pipelines`
- [ ] Batch status endpoint: `GET /v1/batches/{batch_id}/status`
- [ ] Automatic OpenAPI documentation at `/docs` and `/redoc`
- [ ] CORS configuration for React frontend integration
- [ ] Rate limiting and request validation
- [ ] Standardized health (`/healthz`) and metrics (`/metrics`) endpoints

**React Frontend Integration**:

- [ ] CORS middleware configured for React dev/prod environments
- [ ] Frontend-optimized error response format
- [ ] Request/response models optimized for React state management
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation with helpful error messages

**Security & Production Readiness**:

- [ ] Rate limiting per client/endpoint
- [ ] Authentication middleware hooks (JWT-ready)
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation

### 3.2. Batch Conductor Service (Quart-based)

**Core Features**:

- [x] Quart-based microservice (batch_conductor_service) with hypercorn  
  *Implemented in Phase 2A. Lean Quart app with DI wired via Dishka before blueprint registration; hypercorn dev runner integrated in `app.py`.*
- [x] Internal HTTP endpoint: `POST /internal/v1/pipelines/define`  
  *Stub implementation compliant with request/response models, DI-injected service layer, and logging & error handling.*
- [ ] Pipeline dependency resolution engine
- [ ] **REVISED: Event-Driven State Projection.** BCS will consume `common_core` events (e.g., `SpellcheckResultDataV1`) from Kafka to build its own real-time view of batch state. This enhances decoupling and resilience.
  - *Note: This deprecates the need for `els_client_impl.py`. The service will not make synchronous API calls to ELS.*
- [ ] Concurrent request handling with proper error boundaries
- [x] Standard health and metrics endpoints  
  *`/healthz` and `/metrics` delivered with Prometheus registry injection; tests validate responses.*

**Pipeline Intelligence**:

- [ ] Dependency rules engine (e.g., ai_feedback requires spellcheck)
- [ ] Batch state analysis and prerequisite checking
- [ ] Optimized pipeline generation based on current essay states
- [ ] Error handling for ELS communication failures

### 3.3. Integration & Orchestration

**BOS Modifications**:

- [ ] New Kafka consumer for `ClientBatchPipelineRequestV1` commands
- [ ] HTTP client integration with BCS internal API
- [ ] Pipeline orchestration with resolved dependencies
- [x] **Implement Config-Driven Pipeline Generation:** ✅ **Completed**
  - **Architecture:** As per the CTO's recommendation, the pipeline generation logic was implemented using a config-driven approach from day one to avoid technical debt and ensure adherence to our architectural principles.
  - **Components:**
    - **Definitions:** Pydantic models for type-safe configuration are defined in `services/batch_conductor_service/pipeline_definitions.py`.
    - **Configuration:** The actual pipeline structures are defined in a human-readable YAML file at `services/batch_conductor_service/pipelines.yaml`.
    - **Generator:** The `PipelineGenerator` class, responsible for loading and serving pipeline definitions, is implemented in `services/batch_conductor_service/pipeline_generator.py`.

**Common Core Updates**:

- [ ] `ClientBatchPipelineRequestV1` command contract
- [ ] Kafka topic: `huleedu.commands.batch.pipeline.v1`
- [x] BCS internal API request/response models  
  *Implemented in `api_models.py` with Pydantic v2 for type safety and validation.*

### 4.2B. Phase 2B: Batch Conductor Service Hardening (Week 2) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Enhance persistence robustness, failure isolation, and observability for BCS prior to external integrations.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Week 1 Day 1-5:**

- [x] **Service Library Protocol Separation** — Created `AtomicRedisClientProtocol` extending `RedisClientProtocol` to provide atomic operations while maintaining backward compatibility for idempotency-only services. Zero breaking changes to existing mock implementations.

- [x] **Redis Atomic Operations** — Implemented WATCH/MULTI/EXEC pattern with exponential backoff retry logic (up to 5 attempts) for race condition safety. Graceful fallback to non-atomic operations if atomic retries exhausted.

- [x] **Kafka DLQ Production** — Implemented `KafkaDlqProducerImpl` using KafkaBus for pipeline resolution failures. DLQ messages include original event envelope, failure reason, timestamp, and service metadata following standardized schema.

- [x] **Prometheus Metrics** — Exposed `bcs_pipeline_resolutions_total{status="success"|"failure"}` counter at `/metrics` endpoint with proper integration into pipeline resolution service.

- [x] **Comprehensive Testing** — All 24 BCS tests passing including 5 new atomic operation tests covering success scenarios, retry logic, fallback mechanisms, idempotency, and concurrent update simulation.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Atomic Operations**: `_atomic_record_essay_step_completion()` with WATCH/MULTI/EXEC pattern
- **DLQ Schema**: `{schema_version, failed_event_envelope, dlq_reason, timestamp, service}`
- **DLQ Topics**: `<base_topic>.DLQ` pattern (e.g., `huleedu.pipelines.resolution.DLQ`)
- **Metrics Integration**: Pipeline resolution service tracks success/failure rates
- **Protocol Safety**: Existing services using `RedisClientProtocol` unaffected

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All Phase 2B objectives delivered and tested.
