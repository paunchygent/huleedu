# Services

Per-service summaries and links to service-specific documentation.

## Purpose

This directory contains high-level summaries for each microservice in the HuleEdu platform. Each service has detailed documentation in its respective `services/<service>/README.md` directory.

## Service Documentation Location

All service implementation details, setup instructions, and API documentation are maintained within each service's directory:

```
services/<service>/README.md
```

This directory provides quick reference summaries and cross-service overviews.
