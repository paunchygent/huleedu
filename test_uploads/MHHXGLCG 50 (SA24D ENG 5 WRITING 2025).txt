For a Better Future: Crime and Punishment
The ongoing gang war in Sweden at the moment makes pepole quistion the laws about violent crimes and who we should handel crimes comited by people underage. Like I said we have an ongoing gang war in Sweden and the gangs recrutie underage boys and girls to commite crimes like homicide and bomb attacks because children in Sweden don't get punisht as hard as adult. 


The ongoing violence in sweden makes a huge impact on everyone, it has creted a fear of geting robbde or shot at the streets of Sweden. The gangs has also created a big drug problem in Sweden. All the violence has made Sweden from one of the safest countries in the Europe to one of the places with the most shootings and bombings in Europe. The crime wave in Sweden has made a problem with overfilled prisons and we need to put resorcruses on things like more police and larger prisons insted of school and helthcare.


I think we should change our leagl system so it becomes a crime with a long prison sentence to recrutie children as torpedos to help them in the ongoing gangwar. I also think we should have harder punishments for homicide and that should be for all ages, I think if you could get a life senctens in prison when you are 15 year old for exampel it would scare people of from comiting crimes like murder. I think a law that makes the person who hires child hitmans should get the same sentence as the child or worse then the child because he/she was equally involvd in the crime. I think we should adopted the system in the USA which makes it so if you commit multiple crimes you add sentence on sentence, for exampel if you punch a man in the face and the steal a car you get 1 year for the assault and 2 years for the theft, you get 3 years in prison in the USA but in Sweden you only get 2 years in prison.  I also think we should help kids in in Sweden find hobbys and jobs so they don't need to comit crimes to make a living. You could take a more radical approach to the problem like they did in El Salvador, they have inprisond everyone they think have somthing to do with gangs. I don't think that would work in Sweden beacuse our citizens would be enraged because of all the people inprisone and Swedens prisons can't handel that many inmates at the moment but if it get worse it could be a way to solve the problem. 


My conclusion is that we would make higher prison sentences for violent crimes for all ages, so we can stop gangs from hire children to commit crimes.  We should also make strict laws about hireing children to commit crimes. We should also help children find hobbys and jobs so they have something else to do than crime.
