For a better future


I have decided to write about crime and punishment and feeling unsafe. Because that's something that I know many in the world are feeling, atleast sometimes. It can depend on diffrent things as war and conflicts, health issues, bullying and so on. But I'm going to focus on crimes and the punishment. In Sweden were I live I think the system for how people get punished is too kind. 
For an example I know there is many young woman, who are insulted and raped by men and many of the times the men get away with it. Even if they don't get away with it, they get a punishment that even can't be compared with what they've done to an other person. In a few cases they only get punishment in forms of financial statements. 


The outcome of these sort of things is that more people will commit crimes like these and even less law-breaking actions will be reported. Because people will get used to the fact that their traitor will get away or just get a slight punishment, the victim and many others will then go around feeling unsafe. Which is problematic because nobody should go around feeling that way and it builds up an vulnerable society. I get really frustrated when people get away with crimes. Because I think if you done something you should be able to stand for it and take your responebility, atleast show that you sorry and regretful. 


The responibily for the changes doesn't just lay on the court and the system for crimes, it's on the whole society. It's for us who live in the county or city that let these sort of things happend and when it happend nobody gives it enough of attention. I want to see changes like that the society work with eachother and not against eachother. A change like more cameras or groups of people who are out late at night in the neighbourhood checking to see so everything is fine. Would make a huge diffrent, because if a crime would happend, people will be around or a camera would caught it. Which makes it easier to prove that something happend and make the criminal get a harder punishment. 
Promblems like these doesn't just exist in Sweden but in the whole world, if all the people work with eachother and fight for justice it will be an better and safer future locally, nationallt and globally.
