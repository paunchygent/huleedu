For a better future
Humans have been using violence since the beginning to survive. Back then is was a question about life or death, where the main goal of course was to survive the day. But in today's society our world is filled with wars and conflicts where humans kill eachother like animals, like we're not human anymore and our lifes doesn't matter. Wars affect both the people and our planet in a bad way, therefore the conflicts has so stop.


The bombs and missiles destroys not only houses where people live, they're also killing people. We see pictures of kids running in the streets around the ruins of what used to be their home. Kids can't no longer go to school and adults can no longer go to work because of the risk it comes with that they might need to flee and hide from the missils or bombs. So it affects the education as well. In some conflicts they have attacked the hospitals too which means that the wounded and hurted people can't get the help they need and are supposed to be provided. Many families and people have had to say goodbye to loved ones that unfortunately did not make it out alive. People that still would be here today if the war didn't happened.



War affects the rest of the world too. People in other countries fear that the war will continue in other countries, but mostly I think they fear their own lives and countries security. Some people that has family or relatives in the country where the conflict is lives in constant fear and grief, scared that something will happen to them. But it also affects the world in kind of a good way too actually since many countries goes together and decide to help the country in war.


Last but absolutely not the least we have the poor civil people who has to make it through the war. In some countries their needs like water, food and medical care is not able to be provided wich makes them suffer even more. Their living standards are low and even though the rest of the world is trying to help, it's not enough. A lot of the people who has been exposed to war are traumatized from the experience. The things they've seen and been trhrough is more than you can imagine and to recover from that can be hard, especially when they often are refugees in a new counry since they often need to flee. And that is also something that is a consequence of war, the people have to escape, but where are they supposed to go then? One country can't take the whole population and some countries won't take anyone. Many refugees are living a low life with no country to live in at all and the whole process to escape can be hard. It comes with a lot of grief since families sometimes have to seperate from eachother, which of course also is a trauma.


We have to stop seeing war and violence as a solution to problems. Even though the problem seems impossible to compromise about, I promise that violence is not the solution. We do not longer se humans as human and that has to stop. Humans suffer from war. It includes a lot of grief, anger and fear. If we stop the wars it will make a better future for our people who lives on this planet. It will stop the traumas, it will make us feel safe and it will be possible to appreciate life. And everyone deserves to live a happy, safe and joyful life.
