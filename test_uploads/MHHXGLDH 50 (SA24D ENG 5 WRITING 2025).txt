For a Better Future: Right to abortion
I feel like the right to abortion is a clearity, maybe not for all. It should always be the woman's choice if she wants to keep the baby or not. It's not up to the goverment or the president. In some countries around the world it's like this, for example in the US.
If were looking at the US, abortion is not allowed in some states. So either women need to travel super far or the need to keep the baby. This means that if a woman gets raped she should, no she needs to have the baby. That doesn't only affect the mother but also the child. The mother gets menatly unstable, because she will be reminded everyday of the worst thing that has happend to her. And it affects the baby because the mother always gets reminded of this situation. Which can lead to that the child is less loved, but I rarely think this will happend, but it can occur. 


To not be allowed to do an abortion doesn't only affect the women in the US but all the women around the world. And it's just not in the US, but that's what I have heard most about. I would like to change the laws so that women can chose what the want to do. No man or goverment should tell a women what she can or can't do. It's like back in the days when women didn't have any rights. Were moving back in evoultion, to when womens rights didn't exist. All of this is just absurd. This is why I would like to change the laws. For all the women around the world who has no choice. 


What I or others can do to make this change is to protest. Women all around the world are already protesting, but it's not enough. It's not good enough because change hasn't happend. I fell like if we gather a big group of women, and men we could make a difference. Nowdays it's mostly men that is against abortion, what I fell, so if we change their minds, we could have a better shot. 


On the downside though, I think that for example Trump will be against this. I feel like this because he was the one that set the laws in the US, but it's also up to the states themselfs. So I think that he would be aginst this, most likely because hes an uptight man who can't be wrong. Those persons mindsets are quite hard to change.
I also feel like the quote that were killing human beings can be an obsticle. But we are not killing humans. Baby fetuses are organisms. That means that they rely on someone/something, in this case the mother. When the fetus is out of the mother before we say the second month, it can't survive. This is because it's no longer relying on the mother. So thats why were not killing humans, because humans doesn't need anyone to rely on, like the fetus does. 


To change so that women is allowed to do an abortion will do a lot. Women will gain more free choices over their bodys. It will most likely change the status of womens that are menatly unstable. And the most important thing is that women gets back their right. This is why I think that we should have the right to abortion. Not only for women that doesn't want children but for those who get raped, etc. This will chance for all women around the world.
