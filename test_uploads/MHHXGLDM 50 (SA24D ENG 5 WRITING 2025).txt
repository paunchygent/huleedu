For a better future
School is one of the most common reason for teenagers and young adults anxiety. I think that many of us can recognize the feeling of grades determinate our worth on a personal level, not only our academic prestations. School is supposed to teach us and to edicate us, not to have us doubt ourself.


I've been in school for 10 years and in five of those, my work has been judged and graded. As soon as we reached the age when the teacher started to give us a letter, based on how good we are, I started to see how my classmates and people in my surrounding changed. School went from something fun and playful to something your whole future apparently is depending on. Statistics says, at least one person in each classroom, is not showing up to school at all. The school has failed to make every student feel safe and to asure them that they will get the help they need to succes in school, because apparently they don't. 


There could be multiple reasons for a student not being able to go to school. Maybe they have some kind of issue at home for an example. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and has different prerequisites. Something that the society dosen't take aware of while the grades are being set. Let's be real, I´ll take my own country for an example. We have one girl who grew up in sweden, has well educated parents and who gets help with her homework and tests. Then we have another girl, she newly arrived to the country and can't speak the language yet. Her family isn't well educated and she has to do everything school-related on her own. Who do you think has the best chance to finish school with excellent grades? Acknowledge, I didn't even mention anything about how educated any of the girls are on an individual level. In this case, the only thing that matters is where they come from and what their prerequisites are. 


So, how can we help students to reach their goals no matter where they come from or what their prerequisites are? First of all, I think that teachers should be more aware about the contrasts between students. I think that the school system should be more adjusted after the individual needings. At the current time, everyone is meant to sit down and do the exact same thing. Some of us are lucky and are able to concentrate for hours, meanwhile some of us has a disorder that makes our brains start thinking about something else after ten minutes. When a teacher sees a person struggling with school or not showing up to school at all, it's important to ask the person about their needs and what kind of study-material they need to learn. 


It's not unpredicteable that students feels judged on a personal level when a letter is supposed to tell ous how good we are, of course that will lead to selfdoubt. I think that we should find another way of discovering how capable they are to reach they dreamwork, for an example. To make my point clear, I know that finding a way to decide grades without putting pressure on students isn't easy. But there has to be some way that makes students more willing to educate themself. They are no matter what our future, therefore I think that It's so important to focus on their wellbeing in school. For a better future.
