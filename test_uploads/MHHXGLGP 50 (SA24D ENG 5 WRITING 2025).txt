For a better future: 
The debate about women rigth has allways been a big thing in our society, maybe because near half of our population is womens and they allways been the underdogs and forced to figth for justice in a mens ruled the world. A importent movement and subject that involves the free will and influence by womens as more tham just wifes and mums to our kids. A movement I acually think is in start of dying. 


We are in in a socity where womens allready has a lot of the things men has and even if it of coruse is a big problem i think the motion and way handel it today need to change. You has forgotten what the thing was from the start, it isnt women we fight for, it isnt any competision if women or men are the best. Its a movement for our same rights and I think a lot of feminist today of this style are to egoistic to talk about mens right to. A egotism that it in the long way gonna destroy the argumentation. Its not any " We want the rigth to vote" conversation anymore, and that make the way you handel the dissucion more compicated. For a world with a big women´s right you need men to, you need as many peoples as posseble on your side to get what you want and there the problem comes.  


You cant build up the mens as the problem, its only gonna make the feelings betwine men and women more irretating and polorated, something that only build up a we versus them metality. Something that gonna destroy the debate more. This meaning you Ccant book feminist to a school for them in 1-2 hours only talk about how men sucks and are asholes and women sad and need help, Yea fine it is a lot of men harrassing womens, but it destroys the deabte and only gonna lead to men feeling more outmarkt and incicure. The real conferseion isnt mens violent for women, its evil peoples violent to good peoples. I have been at like 5-10 talkings where the school has invited some women or mens talking about viloents and how women getting in toxic realationsships. I have also been in realtionsships where I have men harrasted in differnent way and even its a minority of men getting beaten or violated by women if you compare to the women harrest by men its just as importante. You cant scream in our faces that you are treated different in todays socity, its only gonna scare us away. 


We need to get together for it to work, of course its feels like a war to men treating you wrong if it is that mindset you enter the conversetion. You can't get away all men from the planet, neather you cant get away all women so why fight when we can come together. Try to open your eyes a little bit and acually think of more then yourself or the femist movement in my opinion gonna fade out. If we work toghe insetde it would create a future where we can focus and more then something so meaningless then fighting and blaming things on each other. A kind of respect to each other that would make a important change on the disscusion on globally, nationally and local level.
