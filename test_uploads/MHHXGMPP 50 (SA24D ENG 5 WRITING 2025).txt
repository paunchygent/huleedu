                                          For a better future


We have all thought about the future right? Atleast I have, and I can say that I am very afraid of it. I know for a fact that we or even our kids are going to face alot of problems in the future that even our ancestors wouldn't know about, I am talking about problems like, women's rights or gang crimes. But the worst problem that our world is going to face is the environmental problems like, the world getting warmer, our atmosphere getting thinner and the threat against all living creatures on this planet getting bigger.


By now almost everybody should know about our environmental issues, and we are not on the way of saving ourselves from it. Every day we are polluting the air with our cars and other sorts of veichles and not just that, we are also throwing all our garbage on the ground or in the sea even tho there might be a bin in a 50meter radius where we could easely go and throw our garbage. 


It may not be a problem right now but the more we do it the more issues there will be, and I am not just talking about our issues but our future kids that may not even be able to walk on this earth because of the big problems we have caused. To save us and our children from this we need to change as humans, we need to stopp mass consuming, polluting earth with garbage and carbon dioxid from unnesessary flights, we just need to give our planet some rest. According to studies, we are using the resourses of 5 planets with is at the least five times too mutch. A lot of people are living in the now, they often say "we only live once" witch is the dumbest thing i have ever heard since our future kids and grand children are also wanting to live once, but no since you wanted to live your life like you were the last generation of humans on earth they will not be able to live here thanks to you, that flew around the world just to see you favourite artist for a few hours. To save earth we need to act like we live like we live more than once so that our future can be provided as great sircumstances, as we had when we were born.


If we do as I say and take responsability of our actions we will be able to help create a better future where everybody is healthy and not worrying about the world going down with them. So think that when you don't want to take the train to another country but the plane, take the train, not just for you future but for your neighbours, your countries and the whole worlds future children. So go out and live your life as if you have two lifes!
