Women's Rights


Women are the most important creature that has ever been created. They are the root to all human life and without them we would never exist or be the person that we are today, but somehow women are disrespected and often get disregarded when they have an opionion or knowledge on a subjet simply because of their genus. This has been a huge problem over the last thousand years and it's still a problem to this day.


For instance the wage gap between women and men is really big and unjustified. Women could work twice as much and twice as hard as their male coworker but still not get paid as much as him just because of the fact that the male coworker is a male. We see this all the time in our society and I don't really understand why we have it this way when it is just so obviously wrong. It's frightening the fact that this is justified and normalized by so many people.


To understand why it is this way we have to go back a bit in time. As early as the stories of Adam and Eve the woman has always been looked down upon. She was the one who bit the forbidden fruit and should thereby be punished for eternity with having to carry a child for 9 months. The woman was created from the man's rib in the bible. All of these age old examples makes you understand that this is not a new thing and that it has been like this for a long time. Antother example that is more recent is the fact that women were not allowed to vote in Sweden before 1928! How crazy is that? I mean Sweden is a first world country and one of the most advanced country's in the whole world and it was'nt allowed before that. That is just utterly outrageous to me! 


Now i know that there will be people (men) who don't agree with this and I just have one thing to say to you all and that is grow up! The men who doesn't share my opinion are mostly in there 50s-80s, and conservatives who likes to have things the old fashioned way just because. They never really have any valid arguments or points but they just say its always been like this so why change it. This obviously isn't right  because without change where would we be in todays society? We wouldn't have any new technology or new cures to different diseases.


Women are as I said the most important creature ever. We shouldn't treat them like shit. We should praise them and make them know that they are loved. Change is a good thing when it comes to matters of unfariness and things that shouldn't be this way. Everyone needs women in their life so why not treat them with just as much respect as you would treat a man with? Without a female there is no male.
