For a Better Future


In this moment criminals are commiting crimes all around the world, people are getting robbed, killed and scared. Parents and their children dosen't feel safe knowing whats going on around them, young girls are afraid to walk alone in the dark and young boys gets forced to work for criminals. We can not let it pass this time, we need to open our eyes. This is important for the health and safety around the world.


People dosen´t deserv to live their lives in fear. Everyone should be able to feel safe anytime, not depending on who they are. Crimes and criminals affect us "normal" people in many ways. For example, you got invited to a party but when you think twice you realaise the busses don´t drive after 10 pm and that means you´ll have to walk home. Is that safe? After thinking for a while all the worst senarios comes to you mind, "am I gonna get kidnapped, raped or worst of all... killed?" This kind of thoughts make you scared and even more unsure and it ends with you not going to the party.


Nobody should feel unsafe in this world but today it´s impossible, we need to make drastic changes. Now you may think "how", let me tell you. Punishment. Yes, punishment, in this world people commiting crimes will get punnished. I belive in a high punnishment scale where all crimes should be handled very seriously. But the most important thing is not the punnishment after the crime, the most important thing is before a crime is commited. People needs to be awere of the consecuences of their acctions before anything goes wrong.


All the people on this planet should together work for a safe world without people commiting crimes. I think one of the greatest solutions exept informing especally young people is giving mer recources to the national court because countrys around the world need help when it comes to fight criminals.


This is a problem that needs to be worked on by everyone all aroud the world from every contry, together we can do it.
