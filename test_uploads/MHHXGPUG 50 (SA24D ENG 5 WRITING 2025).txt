For a better future


One thing I have noticed while growing up is how we are treating other people based on how they look or how they act. We all know that racism isn't right and most people does everything to stop racism, but I think we need to do more. I see mean comments on others post on social media everyday and people who aren't invited because of their skincolor. That makes me both sad and angry. It also make me wanna change it for a better future, for today's people and upcoming genarations. I want to be able to help these people in some way but I can't do it alone, that is why I hope that I can change people thoughts on racism and why it's a important subject to bring up. 


All these people around the world get all this hate just based on who they are. I have many examples where you clearly can see how white people act racist against black people. One of them is when it comes to sports, my example is from a football game where a black man missed his penalty. If this where a white man he maybe would get some comments but then everyone would let it be, but in this case the black man got mail to his home where people jumped him with racist and discriminate commets. He also had to turn his phone of because of all the comments on social media. He has spoke out in media himself and talk about how it affected him.  For me this is a clear example that shows how bad the situation is. How do you think people feel that get so much hate just because how they look? I can guess not so good.  This also segregate us as a group and as people. This takes us back to how it was in the past, when we had different bathrooms for black and white people and only white people where aloud to sit in the front of the bus. This rules don't exist in this time of course but the mindset is still there and it's make me upset and ready to do something about it. 


We all could just start with not ignoring the fact that this is a big problem, cause I feel like most people deny it. Maybe we could learn more about it in school to make our young genaration understand whats right and wrong. I also think that it could be good if you weren't aloud to comment racist and discriminate comments. With all technology and knowledge we have today maybe we could develop social media in a way that report or delete those type of comments. 


This is just my own thoughts about it and if we all work together maybe we can change the way people are treating eachother and stop racism. Like I already said I think this is a very important topic to bring up, to make everyone feel safe and not judge by their skincolor. Everyone should be treated the same way.
