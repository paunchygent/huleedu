For a Better Future
In six months there will be a conference held in Valletta, Malta. At the conference we will discuss diffrent subjucts people arund Europe has sent in as issues. 
One of the subjects I will present is Health issues. 


Health Issues is a problem the world and society has always had. A few years ago when our parents and grandparents were younger (written from a teanager) mental health was a topic nobody talked about. Thalking about your mental health was shamefull and oftenly never talked about. Today mental health and health issues in general are frequently talked about. Perhaps I belive that talking about mental illnesses are very important. Feeling feelings should never be shamefull and talking about your problems open with others gives you a realisation that everyone goes through difrent things. Everyone are fighting their own battles. 


Battles we should'nt face on our own. There are many types of Health issues, for exampel: Depression, Eating disorders, Sleeping problems, problems with gaining weight, problems with losing weight, there are so many health issues that could be brought up. These were just a few illnesses. Even though we talk alot more about our feelings today compared to some years back I think we talk way less about it than we should.
 Living with the feeling of being by yourself and that nobody has issues as you can fast build up a feeling of being odd, not fitting in and that it is something wrong with you. Each year many people die from suicide, often because they never felt that they could talk to anyone or that their problems were to big to handle. Handle on their own? maybe. Handle together? No. Together we shall help eachother. Death should NEVER be an alternativ. 


Feeling embaressed to talk about your problems, from own experience I belive is because we think that we are alone. Alone with the feelings and instead of talking about it we instead feel some type of need to look so strong and independent on our own. 
With that said I would like to raise a thought for everyone reading this, wouldn't life be so much easier if we would talk about our feeligs more? I personly thnk so. 
Sharing emotions and thoughts with others doesn't just fill eachother with understanding for one and others, we understand echothers behaviors, it brings people closer to eachother, feeling odd and alone doesn't exist after hearing other people with same experiences and emotions. I don't see any benefits, perhaps only positive aspects with talking about mental issues.  


The goal is that no one should ever feel embaressed to speak up about their feelings. For the future I suggest that schools and organisations start talking about emotions and feelings earlier with children so that talknig about emotions feels natrual from the start. Talking to psychologists, friends and people you feel comfortable talknig to.
