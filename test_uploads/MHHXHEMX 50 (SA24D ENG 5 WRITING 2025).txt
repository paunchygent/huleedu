For a better future


The environment is important for all humans. I certainly think we need to be more friendly towards it than we have been throughout history. The phrase ''environmental problems'' I find to be extremly broad and kind of vague in a sense. There are many different problems located in those two words but I think the most important one and therefore the one i'm going to write about is overconsumption. Overconsumption is such a big problem with the environment because it adds to all of the other problems a tiny bit each. 
In Sweden, the country where i'm from, the population lives as if we had 10 planets to live on instead of just one. Another way of seeing things is that all of the worlds resources would have been consumed in the middle of April if everyone started to live as people do in Sweden since the start of the year. I didn't believe this at first because Sweden is a relatively small country and we are known for recycling which is good for the environment but it is in fact completely true. The problem with overconsumption is that to stop overconsuming people will have to change their way of living drastically. It's commonly known that we have very big problems when it comes to the environment yet the way we live and consume I wouldn't say have declined since we got to know about the environmental problems. I'm not old enough to have been in those times, but speaking to my relatives their lifestyle is pretty much the same. Consumption wise it's almost worse now than before.
I now there are many people researching to find solutions but that's only because people don't want to make huge changes so fast. We know about the problems but choose to ignore it for short-term success. 


It's hard for me to come up with a solution right here right now that will solve overconsumption. I will try to but just to clarify, this text is I feel like only to enlighten it's readers on one of the biggest problems. Now what changes do I suggest? I suggest that the authorities makes forseful changes. Limit the amount of money you can spend in relation to how much you have to spend, make strict changes in transportation rules and similair things. The people overconsuming isn't the middleclass or the working class. It's the people on top. They buy luxurious clothes and get on a flight every other day. By making these alterations it would decrease the consumption and governments could easily regulate their 
CO2 emissions.
If there is politician reading this you probably think that this suggestion would be career-suicide. That there would be riots after making these changes. I think that there would be many that wouldn't like it but if you use a similair line of reasoning like I have then I believe many would approve of it. I sure enough would atleast.
