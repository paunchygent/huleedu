For a better future 


All over the world children lives completly diffrent lives. In sweden we spend a lot of our time in the school, but if you lock around the world, that's not the case for everyone. Education is important to learn about our society and it's also a great oportunity to start the beginning of your dream. You don't choose where you're born or what's your lifestyle locks like, and I don't think that should change your opertunities that much as it does today. Children around the world of diffrent reasons don't all have acces to school. Some of them can't afford or don't have time because they need to work to help their family. In other countries school is a "boy" thing. The problem here is that the world don't give everyone a good opportunity to knowledge and their rights of education.  


If you don't have an education it could lead to lack of knowledge. You may not know better and if that includes a lot of peolpe that can have an negative infect on your country but also the world. For example if the majority of your country votes for a president who has bad values. Maybe that majority didn't went to school when they were young, instead they struggled to help their family to get food on the table. The people then gives the power of their country to a person with bad and selfish intentions wich won't help their country to the better. With that power the president can make it harder for other countries too thru diffrent decicions. But we can prevent or at least make it more difficult that bad decicions makes from a big group people if we give everyone right to education. In todays world I think many have got into a bad circle where you don't have a great economy, and theres no better job for you, because you don't have an education. The same problem going to happen to their chilldren and grandchilldren.


Education for everyone isn't the easiest thing to complete and already now that's a main goal for some countries. However, I think it should be a bigger question and topic in the world. And therefore I would be glad if more politics talk about this and try to make up soulutions, it could be about to make school free in their county. Even we that have education for everyone like Sweden can try to influent other and show the great benefits. It could be hard to make everyone with big power in their country to want to change their system, because what would happend to them then? Would people start to dislike them or would that make them more unsecsecfull. They probobly get much from the system that are going and are afraid education would change the poeples view on them. 


Hopefully education all over the world would make the world better and give everyone a better opportunity to choose their future and follow their dreams. More people would make decicions because they know not because they have to, wich probebly would lead to a better society. But of course people with both education and bad intentions still exist, but it would be harder for them to get a big amount of people with them, wich makes them "invisible" in this big group of educated peolpe.
