For a Better Future 
In this world, in lands and citys we all have a problem that need to be solved. The problem is something that affect and involve everyone. The problem is crime and punishment. The crime dosen's just affect the "bad guy or women" that make the crime and get in to prison, it also affect the rest. It might be a murder when someone or some people get killed and die and that really affect them and the realatives. The loved and nears lose's someone or some that where loved and close to them, that meant a lot to them. It could be a friend or a family member. 


But that dosen't really matter anyways, whatever crime it's, it's wrong and thats why it get punisht. But after all, the punishment is not scarying people to the level that they will in fact not do it. The number of crime is not going down, it's going up. That's a problem that NEED to be solved. Young kids get into criminal grups and doing illigal things just for money and to feel watched. The grupmembers ealdery is hiering young people beacuse they get lighter punishment, (if they get one) and beacuse they do not care about them. The things that matter is money and that they win. To many grups is out on the streets and don't get there punishment. 


In jail people get mixed, one sitting there for some money cheatning and some for extremly muder. When the people get mixed on some many diffrent levels of crimes, they might end up being worse then they were before jail. I'm not saying that every crime without mudeuring should not get punisht but just that diffrent kind of people's crime might not get mixed up together. Diffrent jails for diffrent crimes could be better. I want to see some changes, I know that alot of people want that. The number is not going down, which is a need. But the changes is not an eays solved thing, you can't just say stop making crimes and the criminals will stop. The punishment by itself is not the problem. To lay everthing on the law is easy in the thinking but not in real life. You could say that the laws and punishment need to be changed and that would solve everything. 


But as for long people buy drugs and have diffrent kind of big fightes, or need / want money or whatever it could be the crimes will not end. People will always think diffrent and think that diffrent things are right. To get everyone think the same is impossible, to get everyone to do the same is impossible. And that is not the changes that need to be done. 


The changes that need to be down is to came up to diffrent idées and try til something works. Look around in diffrent contrys and see how they do and if it's working. Try the same and see if that works for your contry. This is not something that is a one person job, everyone need to fight for it if we want to see some changes. If it get to the better the changes will create a better future for everyone. This is beacuse if less time, money and enery get taken from crimes and stuff the one's that need help to not get there, gets the time.
