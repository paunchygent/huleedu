For a Better Future
Everyday in and out someone gets to deal with racism. It's a struggle thats been going on for more than a hundred of years. It may take a long time until all the racism in the world is gone, beacuse of how deeply rooted it can be in some people since slavery times. Rasicm can pass from genaration to generation just as easy as you get your moms sense of humor and your dads eyes.
No matter what ethnicity you have, how you look like or where you come from, doesnt make you less worth of a human. But in some peoples eyes our differences inclusive our appearance, unlike them, can be stinging and disagreeable - and that is what's called racism. 


As a black person myself, who lives in Sweden, have an everyday struggle by thinking of how different I look besides everyone else. It's not often that I see a person of my colour who represents me in tv shows, advertising, or in public. Because of this, me and other people of colour do not get the same amount of the feeling of confidence and acceptance, as the other typical skandinavian looking people in our society. 


In a early future I would like to see a difference, especially that movie producers and journalists, casts and write about a more of a variation of people. I think that this will be a solution that affects many people in a good way, by feeling more gathered in the society than feeling left out and different. 


The people who's looks dominates here in Sweden is the skandinavians with light skin, blue, green, brown eyes, blond or brown hair. And in that case you may think that this discussion is mistaken beacuse of the fact that us people of colour are not as many as the swedish people. But this discussion is infact very important, and a very beggining of a less racist and equal future. When we see a person who represents us we'll be more happy and achieve the feeling of being seen and appreciated, instead of feeling unseen and unimportant.
