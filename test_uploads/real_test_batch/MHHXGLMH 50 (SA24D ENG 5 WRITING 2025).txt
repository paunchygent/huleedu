                       For a better future


Imagine feeling a fear and underestimated all the time just because of you were born a specific gender. You can't choose the gender you were born in, so why would you get punished over something you can't controll?
That's the reality of being born a women everywhere anytime. Being born a woman have always been a punishsment according to the human race, why is that? Why don't you get to go to school like your brothers, or get paid less than your male college. Why would you need to have a pepperspray in your bag or lower the music in your head phones when you walk home at night because of the fear of being raped, killed or kidnaped. Why are women treated so different just because our bodies are build different?


So why are women treated different? Since I can remeber I've always feelt very passionate about working for women's rights. Because I have never understood why women have been treated different, because we are as smart and strong as a man. Why should you just because you were born in the male gender get to have an education on a university or even high school level, work, vote or sport but your sister don't. Because she can be as good or even better than you at most of thoose things, what is different between you two? That you could build muscules more easily?
 
Because that is the situation in a lot of coutrys in the world. A women's task in her life is to be caring, cook, birth and take care of children while her husband is out working and earing money to provide for the family. But a women can be so much more than a stay at home wife. The males that don't belive in eqaulity and women's rights need to realise that a powerful women is not a threat to your power but a help, femenism does not mean taking over and making the males less worth but in my opions it's a life that you can choose your own destiny to. And that should't get stopped because a man feels that his masculinity is less because a women is better at him at work. Men's fear for women being better than them at anything has always existed but don't need to be, just becuse Eve ate the apple doesn't mean that women should get puniched always.


The situation is not the same in the entire world, or are as bad as i have described earlier in my text, because some coutries have comed far in their work for women's rights and feminism like my country Sweden that is a coutry considerd to be equal. But it's not totally equal here ethier. Male earn more money that women doing the same job, women get raped, sexually assulted and treated badly everyday still in 2025. So just because we have comed far in the process of women's rights does not mean we have to stop, because injustice affects everyone. We are gonna come real far in developing and making the world a better place now and in the future for our children if we would just realize that we need eachother and stop being frighted about other sucess.


To summerize, everyone should have the same chance in life no matter what gender you were born in becuse you can't choose what you are born into. And to make a better future we firstly need have eqauity between men and women.
