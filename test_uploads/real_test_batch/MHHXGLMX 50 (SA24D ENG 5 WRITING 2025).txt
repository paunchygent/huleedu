For a better future
Last week a documentary named "skinniest wins" was releast on Svt in sweden. I watched this documentary and the theme of the movie has been stuck in my mind ever since. And my thought in the begining was that this is such a small problem that we don't have to worry about, but I have completely changed my mind and now I want to help you understand why this is actually a big problem. They talked about many different perspectives of why social media has became a huge problem. The problem with it is that young people get the wrong image of how a body should look. There's a high amount of influencers who is promoting eating disourders and skinny content on their social media. This results in kids thinking that they have to be skinny in order to look pretty, which is not true. It's not healthy for kids to watch videos like "what I eat in a day" when they show what they eat and it turn out to be the tiniest amount of food ever.  


I have watched those videos myself, and they are mostly the same. It is always about eating the least you can and being as skinny as possibly. This have had a big affect on me because I constantly think of how much I eat and how much calories something has in it. And don't get me wrong it does not have to be negative to think about calories, but the thing is that kids does not think of it in a healthy way. It affected my and every ones childhood! Because every one constantly hear people talking about losing weigh and hearing comment like "oh are you going to eat all of that". And if this is what you feed your mind with all the time, then of course we are going to get eating disourder habits. Just the other day I heard my sister telling my mom about how she has been called fat in school, even though she's really not fat. But the thing is that she's not skinny and then other kids thinks she is fat. The thing i want to explain is that kids have a fucked up wiew of a healthy body. Because my sister is training 5 times a week, eating healthy and have a good health overall. But yet still the other kids does not think she have a healthy body. This is all because they think a skinny body is the only thing that is healthy.


I think that this needs a change! And you may wonder what we can do to change the situation. My idea is that social media should get a age limit and that this whole thing should be talked about more. The documentary on Svt is the first one I have seen that really talks about how bad the situation is. I really think there should be more people talking about what a healthy body really is. If kids don't get to watch social media and just hear about that every body has it's own beauty then they will not have to think that there is something wrong with their body. It is now up to every single one of us to take our responsebility and stop making comments like "oh are you really going to eat all of that" or "nothing taste as good as skinny feels". 


If we all take our responsebility and the leaders of the world set up an age limit for social media then I know that our future will become better. Many people will have a better health and be more confident in their selves. I also think that we will be happier and enjoy life more!
