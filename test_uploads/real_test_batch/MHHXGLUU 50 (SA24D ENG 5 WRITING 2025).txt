For a Better Future
 
Now days there is happening a crime once a day sort of. The crime we have the biggest problem with right now would I say is criminals in gangs making criminal things. Last year in Sweeden was brutal. There has newer been more shootings in sweeden then that year. And obviosly is somthing wrong here. We can´t let that happend. Our children is dying. I think that we need to get stricter punishment to solve the problem.


A problem with gangcriminals is that they involve so meny young kids. Are you in it you can´t came out. It also affect the families, whos childrens is dying. But I think that you can always chose if you want to get involved or not in some way. Some of you will probubbly say that they are young and can´t do anything. But if you are fifteen years old you now the dangures about it. And if you not want to get involvde you can stay away, don´t be in the placese thay are in. Becuase I think that there is some young people who wants to get in the gang. Becuase thay find it cool, or maybe like a way to be likable. Fore this I think we need more police out in the street, I think that will help to stop the crime to happend. 



And I think that if we are getting stricter punishment, the criminal people wont dear to do the stuff. Becuas now are our punishment in Sweden realy low. And that is why the criminals ceep doing the crimes. Becuase they think it is worth the punishment. They know they will came out of jail faster then centents. 


First of al in my opinion I think that have you maken a crime, you are worth the punishment, and it would be stricter. 
I think that if you have murderd some one you chould not let go. 
If you are younger the 18 a think you chould be abel to get in to jail. Becuase are you capable to kill a humen, you are old enogh to get youre punishment. 


And when it is about other crimes, I think the criminals chould sit more years then they have to do now. Becuase once they get out on the street again the mots of them will just ceep being criminals. And the longer you can ceep them away from the society, is for the better. 


People that are working for this is polititicians, I would say just the right side tho. But they are working on it. Becuase they have seen that it obviosly dosn´t have workt with al this lame punishment the left side has made.

As an exempel for that it works to have stricter punishment is Finland. They have realy strict punishment and thiere crime statitics is way lower than our. 


If we get stricter punishment I think that will lead to a better feuter in Sweden. Becuase if the punishment get stricter I think the criminals won´t dear to make the same brutal crimes. And if they don´t, then the crime statetices will get lower. And it will be a seafter society to live in.
