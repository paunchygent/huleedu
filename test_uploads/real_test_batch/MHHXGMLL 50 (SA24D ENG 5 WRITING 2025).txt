For a Better Future


Imagine a world without men. Everything would have been totally different in so many ways. As a woman you wouldn't have to look back all the time because you are worried that a man is following you when you walk home at night. You could have both your headphones pluged in and you wouldn't need to have your phone ready to call someone just in case. I would have feel so safe and I think that most of the women living on this planet would agree with me. We can't just solve this problem with taking away all the men so instead we need to do something to fix this problem. 


When a man hear people calling themselves feminists they often think that the persons want women to be treated better than men. That's not the case. It's often womens rights that we talk about but that's because women have been and are less "valued" in the society than men. The problem is everywhere, in schools, at work, at home but also when it comes to sports for example. Men already have better rights and to reach equality between the genders me need to fight for womens rights. It is very important to really do something now and change the situation because in many countries the equality is getting worse than it was before. 


So how could we possibly do to fix this problem? Does it really have a solution? I'm sorry, but my answer is that I don't know. Women have already done so much to gain more and better rights but the fight needs to including more men to have a bigger affect on people. One change I would like to see is the way people talk about feminism as a wrote about before. That would mean more men involving to solve the problem and maybe that would help. I also think that we should talk about the problem more because maybe people haven't realised how bad the situation is and how important this problem is to solve. Especially teachers, politicians and parents need to talk about the non equality more because they have a big effect on many people and people look up to them. 


If you are a parent raising a boy you should learn him how to treat a girl. It is very important to take this problem seriously at an early age in a man's life. I think that can be a way to maybe not solve the problem, but to improve the situation. Many problems starts when their is a problem with the ubringing for example abusive parents that can make the kid feel less loved which can affect the choises they make in life. I also think it has much to do with your surrondings and the way people treat you, you will treat them. That's why it is very important to improve the situation in schools. The students affects each other very much. 


Solving this problem would help create a better future globally because everyone, especially the women, would feel more safe and people would treat each other better when their is equality. Women should have the rights to be independent, express themselves, be taken seriously and not to be afraid of getting abused or raped when they are walking home at night. We have already come far on the way but we can't stop here, there are much more to do.
