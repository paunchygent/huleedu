For a Better Future


There isn't one place around the world that doesn't discriminate against women at all. You might think, wow that sounds stupid. And yes, it definitely sounds utterly insane. But when you think about it, every city, country, or continent has problems which involves laws or stigmatization against women's rights. In newer times people might believe that feminism or fighting for freedom isn't the biggest issue we have as a society, but I beg to differ. 


The stigmatization about feminism didn't float up out of nowhere, and it's very clear how we as a society claim to have changed for the better, when the problems around the world simply grows worse. Laws about womens reproductive health in the United States and silencing and humiliating women in Afghanistan is probably the most prominent examples of how our world doesn't cater or care about how women are treated. Even countries in Europe haven't gotten much better over the years, in fact, it only gets worse. 
Hate and segregation is topics all to normalized and the rights of women silently slips beneath the cracks. You might think that the issues women are having in Afghanistan doesn't matter when talking about the rights in your own country. But when so many people as a group have so much hate for women simply existing, it's crystal clear how everything in the patriarchy affects everyone no matter where you're located. Small, simple stuff like a stupid comment or slutshaming is something you might never think about in the grand scheme of things. But when you puzzle everything together for the bigger picture the small things won't stay so small for very long.


To change what is happening around our world the steps are big and hard to make. The first step in my eyes is to realize what the core problem is. And I recognize that it's not the easiest difficulties to solve, but I desperatly hope that my text can make all of you take a step back and asses the very real problems we have to fight for women's rights, no matter how small or "insignificant" it might appear. Every person has their own behavior to critizise and the most important part is to not fall for peer pressure. Calling women names with your buddies might sound appealling in the moment, but being the person who doesn't tolerate trash talk or slutshaming is an admirable trait to have. And who knows, maybe you'll change the small minded people around you. 


A better future is something everyone wants to have, and being a part of the change you want to see in the world may be the best version of yourself you could be. The more we as a society won't tolerate hate against eachother, no matter how big or small, the brighter our futures will shine. So making a space where women's rights aren't seen as less than or insignificant, maybe the stigmatization won't be so prominent anymore. One step in the right direction is a far better way than standing still.
