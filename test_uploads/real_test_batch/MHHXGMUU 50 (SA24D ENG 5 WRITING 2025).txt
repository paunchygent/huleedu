FOR A BETTER FUTURE
We all known someone who has experienced some form of racism, it could either be a mean word or a punch. But what a lot of people misses is that racism is so much more than that. It could be a unusual behavior, a bad joke or a makeup-brand that dont include darker colors. Racism is still today a huge problem all over the world that effects hundreds of children every day. Even here in Sweden racism is very common, even though it´s a county who is supposed to have gotten further in the education.
We need to destroy this "trend" so we can make everyone grow up with the same opportunity´s.


Back in the history we see white people taking advantage of people with dark skin, to get global power and economy. Black people got sold as worthless slaves, to do work whitout getting enough food or rest. This terrifiing history has lived ever since. Even until this day a lot of children still needs to experience racism on a daily bacis. Young people grows up in a world where people gets treated different becuase their skin color.
My bestfriend is black and I have noticed how people treats us diffrently, ecpecially older men and women. One time when we were out shopping, a old man walked past and shouted the n-word to her and keept walking as nothing happend. In shock I looked over to my friend who seemed unbotherd, so I asked why. She told me that she was so used to it that it dont affect her anylonger. She was bullied in her old shool and heard things like that and even worse everyday. I dont belive that you can stop care about someting so awful. 
Bulliyng is way to common and destroys a person more thats even imagined, and to get bullied for your own skin is unimagineble and needs a resolution. 


Racism is a very problematic topic thats hard to solve, but I think that parents and teachers has the possibility to get a end to this rutheless actions. It is obvious that you dont get birth as a racist, therefor we understand that the society stands for this problem. We can also know that the parents playes an important role, to learn their child the right values could acually be the solution to this. An other solution could be to learn about black history in school, it could be good education and help people se the real problematics. Or activities where teachers or adults lifts up that everyone is the same and should be treated like that. I heard a intresting cote that even changed my thoughts - "All of us bleeds red". It is good becuase it really shows that we all are human and should get treated like that!


To make these changes could mean a lot. To learn kids about respect and values should help solving this problem. Less racist leads to less children who gets bullied and 
with less bulliyng the society gets safer for all of us!
