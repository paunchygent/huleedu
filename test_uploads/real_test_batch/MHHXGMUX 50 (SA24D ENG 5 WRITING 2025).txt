For a better future: Women's rights


At lot of you may think that womens rights is a thing that you take for granted. Everybody knows that women have the same rights as men and that the society is equal between the genders, right? But what if I said that you're very wrong. The fact is that right now, all around the world, girls and women are being abused, tortured and even killed for something a man is allowed to do, but they aren't. In some coutries, a woman isn't even allowed to walk the streets without her man. And I know that it may sound unbelivible, but sadly, this is the truth. We have to do something about it, and we've got do it now!


I know that many people see things like this and make i someones elses problem, just because it doesn't effect them. But if we want things to change and make the future a better place, we are the ones who has to change the society for the better. No woman should have to feel scared for her life for doing something that is included in the human rights. No woman should have to risk being mentally or physicaly abused for being seen without full covering clothes by another man. This is something that's beyond our minds, just because we havn't experienced it. But this is many womens reality and therefor I feel the need to spread this information and make people aware of what's really happening inte the world.


If we work together as a community and fight for the rights of half of the worls population, we may overcome a lot of the problems. I know that some peolpe see this problem as a part of some religion, but it's not. I'll admit, there's some traditions in a couple religions that doesn't allow women to do do whatever they want or wear whatever they want. But I can promise you that it's not some religions fault that men feel the need to unalive a woman for the commiting smallest mistake. So instead of blaming our culture or religion, we have to face the facts. Women around the world can't live the life they were granted when they were born, and it's our responsability to look out for them and change their and our worlds future.


The solution to this difficult question isn't easy, but I have some ideas that may word. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, we have to work together. People all around the word need to have the courage to stand up and help when they see a woman in need. And in the countries where women doesn't have any rights, the men need to step up and protect our them. We need to look out for eachother and be brave in tense situations. Another thing we can do is raise money to bulid shelters for women in need. If everybody raise the smallest amout of money, the gourverment in numerous coutries would be able to build the shelters. 


If we start working for women's rights now, we may have overcome the problem in just a couple of years. This will not only effect the women and girls who suffers right now, but also the girls who will be born and actually be able to grow up and live a normal life without any rules that stops them from living their lifes. With this said, I hope I've made you reconsider making this someone elses problem and start acting for an equal future!
