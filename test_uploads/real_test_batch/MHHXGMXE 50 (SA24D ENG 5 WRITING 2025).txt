For a Better Future


We're living in a world where some people spend their whole lives not having to worry about money. For many people this is an absurd thought and a non-achievable way to live. Because for so many people money is something you work hard to earn and still at the end of the day don't have enough of. While some people invest their money in companys or buy yet another car, other people live on the street, struggling daily to even be alive. The enormous gap between rich and poor that we see so often, is one of the biggest problems in todays society and the root cause to so much more. 


In todays society, people with money can pay for the best healthcare, education and overall living there is. While these people pay to live in the finest houses in the calm neighborhoods and sends their children to the safest schools with the best education, the less wealthy have to share whats left. Naturally, the rich will live in the nice neighborhoods, ideal for children to grow up, all while the poor will live in the less safe suburbs with risk of violence and criminality. Here we set a standard that later on form these peoples futures. Some people have all the right possibilitys to achive a great future while others have to work twise as hard to try and achive something more than what's alredy cut out for them. 


If our futures are decided by where we live and what we can afford people will be divided by their wealth and never be able to be anything other then what their set out to be. The people that can afford education will be able to take the well paid jobs that require said education all while the poor without education will work at the underpaid jobs. This creates a cycle thats hard to break and by dividing people by their wealth, the gap between the rich and poor grows even bigger. 


I would like to see a world where the odds are more even, where your life and future isn't alredy set in stone because of your wealth and where you grew up. There will always be people thats rich and poor and I'm not saying that there's an easy solution, however, by dividing the money in the world a little more even we can solve alot of the problems that we as a society struggles with today. This solution do require that the rich of the world are willing to share their wealth which often causes a problem. My thought however is that if you worry about sharing your wealth, you are not the person I have in mind. What I really mean is that the overly rich people of this world, lets say Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, are the ones that should share their wealth. Because imagine just a small precentage of their wealth, being used to help poor people get the education they deserve and recive healthcare. 


A world where everyone gets the opportunity to achieve the future that they want, no matter how their economy or living situation looks, is a world I want to live in and watch future children grow up in. Because imagine growing up, being told that your future is already decided, all because there's people in this world that have the money to make a change, but choose not to.
