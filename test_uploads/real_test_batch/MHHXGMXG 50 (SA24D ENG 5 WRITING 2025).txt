For a Better Future


Some of you might think that this world is good. Some of you might think that this world is bad. However, one thing most of us has in common is that we all think that certain things and topics are more important than others. For me, as a woman, I think we need to speak more about Women's Rights. Not only because half of the world population are women, because I feel like we are not being taken seriously.


Think about it; half of the population in the world are women, yet we have never not fighted for our rights. Take public voting as an example. It was not until 1921 until women got their right to vote in Sweden. They had to fight for it, and we still do, because we take nothing for granted. I am obviously privileged to live and grow up in a country like Sweden, and my heart aches for the women in other countries who does not have all the rights and advantages that I have. This is exactly why we need to talk about it on a global level. I do not want to be egoistic and only think about the issues that affect me. I think that other people should have this mindset as well. 


Many politicians has a bad mindset in my opinion. They only think about themselves. If they are priveleged, then it is all good for the rest of the population. That is sadly not the truth. Seeing what is going on in the United States is worse than a horror movie. All the rights that women and minorities have been fighting for, is being taken away by president Donald Trump. He is a crazy president who brainwashes and manipulates his own supporters. A very important example of some of the rights that he and his political party has been taking away is the right for a woman to get an abortion. In some states you cannot do an abortion, no matter what the case is. No matter if you got raped, no matter if there is incest, no matter if you are too young, no matter if you genuinely just do not want a child. 
A few years ago, we all thought that this world was great, that we all had many oppurtunities. Now we are all watching the United States move backwards.


A worst case scenario, that actually is possible, is that other countries, including Sweden, will take inspiration from the Untied States. This is why we need to inform more people about this. We need to state our opinion and make the politicians see us and the things we want. If we all stick together and work for it, it will change for the better, for a better future. If men and women had equal rights, it would be a perfect world. In a realistic mind, this is not possible, but we can all dream and keep on fighting. 


Women are thre reason we are here. They carry children and take care of them, yet people are not taking them seriously. They complain and take their rights away. It does not really sit right with me, and I hope that you will join me in my fight for Women's Rights. For a better future.
