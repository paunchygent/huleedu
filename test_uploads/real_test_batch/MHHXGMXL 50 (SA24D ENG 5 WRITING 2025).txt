For a Better Future:


They say, if your country is good enough, everyone has gone to school and everyone will eventually go to school. They've created this place to learn, to get smart, and to get a grade that will affect what you do for the rest of your life. The idea is great, go to a place with similar people and learn stuff about the world to not seem entirely stupid. But then the so-called schools start to feel like prisons, with loads of assignments and exams, that a literal kid is supposed finish under pressure. You start to wonder if they really want the best for you, or if it's some kind of social experiment, to see how much pressure you can put on a child before they break.
        School has the responsibility of teaching kids what's wrong or right, how to spell "cucumber" and why some king decided to run away. It's awesome, really. Everyone knows how important it is to be educated to know what's going on in the world, and to not make mistakes. But there comes a time, around when the kid is twelve, where they start to compare the kids with eachother, ranking them based on how good they are in different subjects, with what they like to call grades. School suddenly wants all kids to have a letter represent how good they perform, and that letter will later determine what this kid can and cannot do in the future, as an adult. Think a little about this, a kid's performance as a teenager, will affect their whole life.
        Not only will the grades affect our lives, but also our brains. Humans are animals, we have survival instincts, and a lot of the time these instincts say "be good enough for people to accept you". This has been a thing ever since we lived in caves – we need to be accepted in order to have people help us when in need. This means that we will start to get competetive and anxious about our grades, which will get our brains focused on only that. Considering we have grades from twelve years old up until nineteen, it's a long time always stressing and feeling bad about studies and grades. That's also the period where a kids brain is developing at most, which is good for learning, but will also drain every last bit of energy that a person has. They're supposed to both develop as a person, but also spend all of their time learning stuff, just because school thinks it's somewhat useful.
        I feel like we need a change in school systems. We cannot keep slowly destroying our youths. They're the ones that will take care of our future, and if they spend more than the energy they have right now, there won't be any left to take care of our, and their, future. I'm saying the system right now is created by an adult, but also for an adult, not a teenager. It's too much preassure for a kid to endure, but an adult might think it's fine for the simple reason that they have already grown up and doesn't have to spend energy on developing anymore.
        With school systems adapted to teenagers, teenagers will be able to succeed, without insane amounts of pressure and stress. It's not the adults who are supposed to go there and learn, get smart and get grades, it's the teenagers. So why did schools think it was a smart idea to create a school system based on an adult's capabilites, and not a teenager's?
