Human rights


For a better future
I think that human rights is an dificul part in our lifestyle's. It has been up for discuss a few times and it has been better during the year's, but it has to be more serious. We had a lot of problem with human rights and that everyone should be accepted like they are. In the past time, for over hundred years ago, it was really strict and everyone needed to live at the similar rules. The women was at home and took care about the children and the man was out in war. It was rules about the wedding between a woman and a man and everyone who liked the same gender was weirdos, that was not okey. Today is these things different, it is more same between a woman and a man, in work, the roll's at home and at the socity. It's okey to get married with the same gender and love who ever we want.


The today's problem is that everyone is not accepted in their own body, their own clothes and their own lifestyle. Everyone around has a point how everyone should live, a flashback how it was in the past time. I think that human rights has a big perspective and a smaller. The big perspective with human rights s1is what the states do, witch people they take in at their country, if it does matter witch home country they come from, if they decide witch roll a woman and a man should have at home and big things like that. A "smaller" perspective, I think is what we human in a socity need to do to live up to these goal's and get the human rights. Today we have a big problem with the social media. It's really easy to seat behind a screem and write hate to people you don't know. This affect people negative and at the end of the day, everyone is affected. 


In a perfect world with every detail of human rights, everyone should be recognized like they are. I think it's difficult to find a answer what exactly we need to do to become the human rights, I think that everyone in a world and socity need to take their own responsible and do the world better together. I think the key is respect, we need to have respect against each other. If the human rights be better locally, nationally and globally, the future will be better for our next generation.
