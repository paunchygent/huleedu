For a better future
Today, one of our biggest environmental problem is that the earth is slowly but surely heating up. While it's a problem that is taken very seriously by environmental activists and experts. The progress of finding solutions that could be executed in this day and age, that would also bring a significant change, seems to far away in comparison to the seriousness of the problem. 


Solutions to this problem is crucial to both humanity and the environment. Some animals and ecosystems can't handle the heating temperature on earth. This can not only cause problems in the ecosystems, but can in worst case result in some species going extinct. The rising temperature is also negative becuase the ice that's been on earth for millions of years is slowly starting to melt. Which is bad for the animals that live in the ice cold environment, like polarbears. This means that their environment is getting warmer och and shrinking in size. But the melting of the ice can also result in the rising of sealevels, which would affekt both marine life and countries close to seashore. 


While the heating of the earth has many consequences, the gasas in the atomsphere, that creates the problem, also creates another problem. The more gases that gets released, the harder it gets for the suns heatwaves to leave the earth. Resulting in more heat staying on earth and thus contributing in the rising temperature. But while the layer of gases makes it harder for heat to leave the atmosphere. There are some gases that we humans let out that breaks down the shell like layer protecting us from the suns UV-rays. Which can rise our risk of getting for exampel skincancer when not protecting ourselfs from the sun. But what can we as individuals do to help with this problem?


Well there is a lot of things we can do to decrease the amount of gases that gets let out. For example can less driving be a positive thing. I wish that more people chose to take more environmental options like the buss or train, or maybe cykel if that's an option. Another thing that contributes heavily to the releasing of gases is produkt transportation. Which means that buying produkts from closer to home will make a big difference. And even if people feel that they can't make a difference, I still believe that it's important to have a mindset that you can. 


Because the biggest challange with this problem is that everyone needs to work together to make a difference. That's why the mindset of not being able to make a change is dangerous. Maybe if everyone had the mindset of being able to contribute to the change then maybe we have a chance in creating a society that collectively works to better this problem.


And in doing so we could protect the environment, the animals and every individual on earth from the negative effekts of the problem. And creating a better future for earth and its inhabitents.
