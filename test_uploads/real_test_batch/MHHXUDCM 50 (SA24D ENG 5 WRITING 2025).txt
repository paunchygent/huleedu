For a better future
I belive that cyberbullying is one of societys biggest problemes. To build a better future we must tackle cyberbullying today. A close friend of mine got cyberbullied 2 years ago and it affected her so much that she got depressed and stopped going to school. We have to do some kind of change. Socialmedia plattforms should be a place where you can feel safe and have fun, talking to your friends, sharing pictures from your trips and stuff like that, but right now that's not the case.  


The main problem right now is how easy it is with anonymity. Everyone can make an account on any socialmedia plattform without showing your real identity. As I mensioned before a close freind of mine got bullied 2 years ago. It all started with a hate comment she got on her instagram post. She got a little sad in the moment but she schaked it off quite fast. The accounts name was "Ptivate123" and it kept commenting awful things on my friends account. The comments where all about her looks and that she was ugly. After around 3 months my friend had gotten so affected by the hate comments and texts she got, that she stopped going to school. I came to her house a couple of times and she was a completley diffrent person. She went from being a positive happy confident girl, to being quite and insecure. It took almost one and a half year for her to fully recover from the bullying and for the comments to stop. To this day we still dont know who it was behind that acount. My friend is just one of thousunds of offers. To avoid people getting depressed and isolating thereselfs, it's important to make a change. Otherwhise it will have a negative affect globally with more depressed and issolated people. 



So what should we do to make it stop?  In my opinion I think that we have to start educating young people about cyberbulliyng and its consequenses, and sharpen the age limits on socialmedia as well. In that way we can protect our children from getting bullied on the internet. My idea is that if you are under the age of 13, your parents should have acess to your account. In that way we can have controll over what our children posts and comments, and make sure thats it's not something innapropieat. Everyone with an account on socialmedia has a responsibility and we all have to work as a team to make it a safe place, for a better future without cyberbulliyng.
