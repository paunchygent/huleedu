For a Better Future


Crime is when a person does something against the rules that have been set up in a community to keep everybody safe. If you break those rules and live under the govern of those people who set the rules up, you will be punished. Punishment is today a jailsentence or money, like bail and tickets. But right now in sweden, the criminals go without punishment and get released quite easliy. Some criminals get money for being imprisoned for too long and some get no sentence at all. 


Sweden nowadays feels unsafe. You do not want to walk alone on the streets, and everyday on the news you see a robbery worse than the last. Yesterday i saw a little boy selling Majblommor getting robbed. If we keep letting criminals get  away with doing these atrocious acts we will be no better than them. How long will we let criminal people govern our decicions. We as a state need to be unified against criminals and put an end to this reign of terror that the criminals have today.


A change in the justice system is for the better. We need to put harsher punishments on criminals who have comitted heinous crimes.  In sweden we only prosecute for one of the crimes that the individuall did. Today we give a life sentance wich is usally around 25 years if u have commited one very bad crime, and then all the other charges get overlooked. How can we only give them the set amount of years for one rape when the criminal might have raped 25 people. Not only do we not prosecute correctly, we cant even catch the criminals doing the crimes. An insane example is the murder of Olof Palme wich hasnt been solved even after 40 years. We keep letting criminals get away with crimes because we ourselfs do not want to get involved. The average swede whould not stop a robbing, they whould rather just walk by and pretend it never happend.


To change, we need to change the rules. We need more police, and give them more freedom to act on suspision. We need the justice system to change the way they prosecute so that all charges can be charged. We need to build prisions to hold criminals. We will need to change the whole structure of our society as we know it. But i think it will be for the better, if it is to stop criminals and make the people of sweden feel safe again. To make these changes we have to stand up together and pressure the government to make decisions, to be a unified front against crimes. Lets stop the fear reign the criminals have.


This will make sweden a more unified country. Our streets will be safe and people do not have to worry about walking alone anymore. The country can focus on internationall relationships and give the country a better economical stance in the coming years. We can stop worrying about the safety of our children. We can also start putting out aid to other countries with problems that they have, like starvation. So a better justice system will be good for us locally, nationally and globally. So lets strive together for a better Sweden and a better world
